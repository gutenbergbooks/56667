<p class="transnote">The first part of Leonard W. King's History of Babylon is available
as A History of Sumer and Akkad, an Account of the Early Races of
Babylonia from Prehistoric Times to the Foundation of the Babylonian
Monarchy.</p>


<h4><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h4>


<p>In the first volume of this work an account was given
of the early races of Babylonia from prehistoric times
to the foundation of the monarchy. It closed at the
point when the city of Babylon was about to secure
the permanent leadership under her dynasty of West-Semitic
kings. The present volume describes the
fortunes of Babylonia during the whole of the dynastic
period, and it completes the history of the southern
kingdom. Last autumn, in consequence of the war, it
was decided to postpone its publication; but, at the
request of the publishers, I have now finished it and
seen it through the press. At a time when British
troops are in occupation of Southern Mesopotamia,
the appearance of a work upon its earlier history may
perhaps not be considered altogether inopportune.</p>

<p>Thanks to recent excavation Babylon has ceased to
be an abstraction, and we are now able to reconstitute
the main features of one of the most famous cities of
the ancient world. Unlike Ashur and Nineveh, the
great capitals of Assyria, Babylon survived with but
little change under the Achæmenian kings of Persia,
and from the time of Herodotus onward we possess
accounts of her magnificence, which recent research has
in great part substantiated. It is true that we must
modify the description Herodotus has left us of her
size, but on all other points the accuracy of his information
is confirmed. The Lion Frieze of the Citadel and
the enamelled beasts of the Ishtar Gate enable us to
understand something of the spell she cast. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
claimed that the site has been identified of her most
famous building, the Hanging Gardens of the royal
palace; and, if that should prove to be the case, they
can hardly be said to have justified their reputation.
Far more impressive is the Tower of Babel with
its huge Peribolos, enclosing what has been aptly
described as the Vatican of Babylon.</p>

<p>The majority of the buildings uncovered date from
the Neo-Babylonian period, but they may be regarded
as typical of Babylonian civilization as a whole. For
temples were rebuilt again and again on the old lines,
and religious conservatism retained the mud-brick walls
and primitive decoration of earlier periods. Even
Nabopolassar's royal palace must have borne a close
resemblance to that of Hammurabi; and the street network
of the city appears to have descended without
much change from the time of the First Dynasty. The
system which Hammurabi introduced into the legislation
of his country may perhaps have been reflected
in the earliest attempt at town-planning on a scientific
basis. The most striking fact about Babylon's history
is the continuity of her culture during the whole of the
dynastic period. The principal modification which took
place was in the system of land-tenure, the primitive
custom of tribal or collective proprietorship giving place
to private ownership under the policy of purchase and
annexation deliberately pursued by the West-Semitic
and Kassite conquerors. A parallel to the earlier
system and its long survival may be seen in the village
communities of India at the present day.</p>

<p>In contrast to that of Assyria, the history of
Babylon is more concerned with the development and
spread of a civilization than with the military achievements
of a race. Her greatest period of power was
under her first line of kings; and in after ages her
foreign policy was dictated solely by her commercial
needs. The letters from Boghaz Keui, like those from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Tell el-Amarna, suggest that, in keeping her trade connexions
open, she relied upon diplomacy in preference
to force. That she could fight at need is proved by her
long struggle with the northern kingdom, but in the
later period her troops were never a match for the
trained legions of Assyria. It is possible that Nabopolassar
and his son owed their empire in great measure
to the protecting arm of Media; and Nebuchadnezzar's
success at Carchemish does not prove that the Babylonian
character had suddenly changed. A recently
recovered letter throws light on the unsatisfactory
state of at least one section of the army during
Nebuchadnezzar's later years, and incidentally it suggests
that Gobryas, who facilitated the Persian occupation,
may be identified with a Babylonian general of
that name. With the fall of Media, he may perhaps
have despaired of any successful opposition on his
country's part.</p>

<p>Babylon's great wealth, due to her soil and semi-tropical
climate, enabled her to survive successive
foreign dominations and to impose her civilization on
her conquerors. Her caravans carried that civilization
far afield, and one of the most fascinating problems of
her history is to trace the effect of such intercourse in
the literary remains of other nations. Much recent
research has been devoted to this subject, and the great
value of its results has given rise in some quarters to
the view that the religious development of Western
Asia, and in a minor degree of Europe, was dominated
by the influence of Babylon. The theory which underlies
such speculation assumes a reading of the country's
history which cannot be ignored. In the concluding
chapter an estimate has been attempted of the extent
to which the assumption is in harmony with historical
research.</p>

<p>The delay in the publication of this volume has
rendered it possible to incorporate recent discoveries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
some of which have not as yet appeared in print.
Professor A. T. Clay has been fortunate enough to
acquire for the Yale University Collection a complete
list of the early kings of Larsa, in addition to other
documents with an important bearing on the history of
Babylon. He is at present preparing the texts for
publication, and has meanwhile very kindly sent me
transcripts of the pertinent material with full permission
to make use of them. The information
afforded as to the overlapping of additional dynasties
with the First Dynasty of Babylon has thrown new
light on the circumstances which led to the rise of
Babylon to power. But these and other recent discoveries,
in their general effect, do not involve any
drastic changes in the chronological scheme as a whole.
They lead rather to local rearrangements, which to a
great extent counterbalance one another. Under
Babylon's later dynasties her history and that of
Assyria are so closely inter-related that it is difficult to
isolate the southern kingdom. An attempt has been
made to indicate broadly the chief phases of the
conflict, and the manner in which Babylonian interests
alone were affected. In order to avoid needless
repetition, a fuller treatment of the period is postponed
to the third volume of this work. A combined account
will then also be given of the literature and civilization
of both countries.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to
Monsieur F. Thureau-Dangin, Conservateur-adjoint
of the Museums of the Louvre, for allowing me last
spring to study unpublished historical material in his
charge. The information he placed at my disposal I
found most useful during subsequent work in the
Ottoman Museum at Constantinople shortly before
the war. Reference has already been made to my
indebtedness to Professor Clay, who has furnished me
from time to time with other unpublished material, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
which detailed acknowledgment is made in the course
of this work. With Professor C. F. Burney I have
discussed many of the problems connected with the
influence of Babylon upon Hebrew literature; and I am
indebted to Professor A. C. Headlam for permission to
reprint portions of an article on that subject, which I
contributed in 1912 to the <i>Church Quarterly Review.</i></p>

<p>To Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge my thanks are due,
as he suggested that I should write these histories, and
he has given me the benefit of his advice. To him, as
to Sir Frederic Kenyon and Mr. D. G. Hogarth, I am
indebted for permission to make use of illustrations,
which have appeared in official publications of the
British Museum. My thanks are also due to Monsieur
Ernest Leroux of Paris for allowing me to reproduce
some of the plates from the "Mémoires de la Délégation
en Perse," published by him under the editorship of
Monsieur J. de Morgan; and to the Council and
Secretary of the Society of Biblical Archæology for
the loan of a block employed to illustrate a paper I
contributed to their Proceedings. The greater number
of the plates illustrating the excavations are from
photographs taken on the spot; and the plans and
drawings figured in the text are the work of Mr. E. J.
Lambert and Mr. C. O. Waterhouse, who have spared
no pains to ensure their accuracy. The designs upon
the cover of this volume represent the two most prominent
figures in Babylonian tradition. In the panel on
the face of the cover the national hero Gilgamesh is
portrayed, whose epic reflects the Babylonian heroic
ideal. The panel on the back of the binding contains a
figure of Marduk, the city-god of Babylon, grasping in
his right hand the flaming sword with which he severed
the dragon of chaos.</p>

<h4>INTRODUCTORY: BABYLON'S PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF ANTIQUITY</h4>


<p>The name of Babylon suggests one of the great
centres from which civilization radiated to other
peoples of the ancient world. And it is true
that from the second millennium onwards we have
evidence of the gradual spread of Babylonian culture
throughout the greater part of Western Asia. Before
the close of the fifteenth century, to cite a single
example of such influence, we find that Babylonian had
become the language of Eastern diplomacy. It is not
surprising perhaps that the Egyptian king should have
adopted the Babylonian tongue and method of writing
for his correspondence with rulers of Babylon itself or
of Assyria. But it is remarkable that he should employ
this foreign script and language for sending orders to
the governors of his Syrian and Palestinian dependencies,
and that such Canaanite officials should use the same
medium for the reports they despatched to their
Egyptian master. In the same period we find the
Aryan rulers of Mitanni, in Northern Mesopotamia,
writing in cuneiform the language of their adopted
country. A few decades later the Hittites of Anatolia,
discarding their old and clumsy system of hieroglyphs
except for monumental purposes, borrow the same
character for their own speech, while their treaties with
Egypt are drawn up in Babylonian. In the ninth
century the powerful race of the Urartians, settled in
the mountains of Armenia around the shores of Lake
Van, adopt as their national script the writing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Assyria, which in turn had been derived from Babylon.
Elam, Babylon's nearest foreign neighbour, at a very
early period had, like the Hittites of a later age,
substituted for their rude hieroglyphs the language
and older characters of Babylon, and later on they
evolved from the same writing a character of their own.
Finally, coming down to the sixth century, we find the
Achæmenian kings inventing a cuneiform sign-list to
express the Old Persian language, in order that their
own speech might be represented in royal proclamations
and memorials beside those of their subject provinces of
Babylon and Susiania.</p>

<p>These illustrations of Babylonian influence on
foreign races are confined to one department of culture
only, the language and the system of writing. But
they have a very much wider implication. For when a
foreign language is used and written, a certain knowledge
of its literature must be presupposed. And since
all early literatures were largely religious in character,
the study of the language carries with it some acquaintance
with the legends, mythology and religious beliefs
of the race from whom it was borrowed. Thus, even
if we leave out of account the obvious effects of commercial
intercourse, the single group of examples
quoted necessarily implies a strong cultural influence
on contemporary races.</p>

<p>It may thus appear a paradox to assert that the
civilization, with which the name of Babylon is associated,
was not Babylonian. But it is a fact that for
more than a thousand years before the appearance of
that city as a great centre of culture, the civilization it
handed on to others had acquired in all essentials its
later type. In artistic excellence, indeed, a standard
had been already reached, which, so far from being
surpassed, was never afterwards attained in Mesopotamia.
And although the Babylonian may justly be credited
with greater system in his legislation, with an extended
literature, and perhaps also with an increased luxury of
ritual, his efforts were entirely controlled by earlier
models. If we except the spheres of poetry and ethics,
the Semite in Babylon, as elsewhere, proved himself a
clever adapter, not a creator. He was the prophet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Sumerian culture and merely perpetuated the achievements
of the race whom he displaced politically and
absorbed. It is therefore the more remarkable that his
particular city should have seen but little of the process
by which that culture had been gradually evolved.
During those eventful centuries Babylon had been but
little more than a provincial town. Yet it was reserved
for this obscure and unimportant city to absorb within
herself the results of that long process, and to appear
to later ages as the original source of the culture she
enjoyed. Before tracing her political fortunes in detail
it will be well to consider briefly the causes which
contributed to her retention of the place she so suddenly
secured for herself.</p>

<p>The fact that under her West-Semitic kings
Babylon should have taken rank as the capital city does
not in itself account for her permanent enjoyment of
that position. The earlier history of the lands of
Sumer and Akkad abounds with similar examples
of the sudden rise of cities, followed, after an interval of
power, by their equally sudden relapse into comparative
obscurity. The political centre of gravity was continually
shifting from one town to another, and the
problem we have to solve is why, having come to rest
in Babylon, it should have remained there. To the
Western Semites themselves, after a political existence
of three centuries, it must have seemed that their
city was about to share the fate of her numerous
predecessors. When the Hittite raiders captured and
sacked Babylon and carried off her patron deities, events
must have appeared to be taking their normal course.
After the country, with her abounding fertility, had
been given time to recover from her temporary depression,
she might have been expected to emerge once
more, according to precedent, under the aegis of some
other city. Yet it was within the ancient walls of
Babylon that the Kassite conquerors established their
headquarters; and it was to Babylon, long rebuilt and
once more powerful, that the Pharaohs of the eighteenth
Dynasty and the Hittite kings of Cappadocia addressed
their diplomatic correspondence. During Assyria's
long struggle with the southern kingdom Babylon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
always the protagonist, and no raid by Aramean or
Chaldean tribes ever succeeded in ousting her from
that position. At the height of Assyrian power she
continued to be the chief check upon that empire's
expansion, and the vacillating policy of the Sargonids in
their treatment of the city sufficiently testifies to the
dominant <i>rôle</i> she continued to play in politics. And
when Nineveh had fallen, it was Babylon that took her
place in a great part of Western Asia.</p>

<p>This continued pre-eminence of a single city is in
striking contrast to the ephemeral authority of earlier
capitals, and it can only be explained by some radical
change in the general conditions of the country. One
fact stands out clearly: Babylon's geographical position
must have endowed her during this period with a
strategical and commercial importance which enabled
her to survive the rudest shocks to her material prosperity.
A glance at the map will show that the city
lay in the north of Babylonia, just below the confluence
of the two great rivers in their lower course. Built
originally on the left bank of the Euphrates, she was
protected by its stream from any sudden incursion of
the desert tribes. At the same time she was in
immediate contact with the broad expanse of alluvial
plain to the south-east, intersected by its network of
canals.</p>

<p>But the real strength of her position lay in her
near neighbourhood to the transcontinental routes of
traffic. When approaching Baghdad from the north
the Mesopotamian plain contracts to a width of some
thirty-five miles, and, although it has already begun
to expand again in the latitude of Babylon, that city
was well within touch of both rivers. She consequently
lay at the meeting-point of two great avenues of
commerce. The Euphrates route linked Babylonia
with Northern Syria and the Mediterranean, and was
her natural line of contact with Egypt; it also connected
her with Cappadocia, by way of the Cilician
Gates through the Taurus, along the track of the later
Royal Road.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Farther north the trunk-route through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Anatolia from the west, reinforced by tributary routes
from the Black Sea, turns at Sivas on the Upper Halys,
and after crossing the Euphrates in the mountains, first
strikes the Tigris at Diarbekr; then leaving that river
for the easier plain, it rejoins the stream in the neighbourhood
of Nineveh and so advances southward to
Susa or to Babylon. A third great route that Babylon
controlled was that to the east through the Gates
of Zagros, the easiest point of penetration to the
Iranian plateau and the natural outlet of commerce
from Northern Elam.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Babylon thus lay across
the stream of the nations' traffic, and in the direct
path of any invader advancing upon the southern
plains.</p>

<p>That she owed her importance to her strategic
position, and not to any particular virtue on the part
of her inhabitants, will be apparent from the later
history of the country. It has indeed been pointed
out that the geographical conditions render necessary
the existence of a great urban centre near the confluence
of the Mesopotamian rivers.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And this fact is
amply attested by the relative positions of the capital
cities, which succeeded one another in that region after
the supremacy had passed from Babylon. Seleucia,
Ctesiphon and Baghdad are all clustered in the narrow
neck of the Mesopotamian plain, and for only one short
period, when normal conditions were suspended, has
the centre of government been transferred to any
southern city.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The sole change has consisted in the
permanent selection of the Tigris for the site of each
new capital, with a decided tendency to remove it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the left or eastern bank.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> That the Euphrates should
have given place in this way to her sister river was
natural enough in view of the latter's deeper channel
and better water way, which gained in significance as
soon as the possibility of maritime communication was
contemplated.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole period of Babylon's supremacy
the Persian Gulf, so far from being a channel
of international commerce, was as great a barrier as
any mountain range. Doubtless a certain amount of
local coasting traffic was always carried on, and the
heavy blocks of diorite which were brought to Babylonia
from Magan by the early Akkadian king Narâm-Sin,
and at a rather later period by Gudea of Lagash,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
must have been transported by water rather than over
land. Tradition, too, ascribed the conquest of the
island of Dilmun, the modern Bahrein, to Sargon of
Akkad; but that marked the extreme limit of Babylonian
penetration southwards, and the conquest must
have been little more than a temporary occupation
following a series of raids down the Arabian coast.
The fact that two thousand years later Sargon of
Assyria, when recording his receipt of tribute from
Upêri of Dilmun, should have been so far out in his
estimate of its distance from the Babylonian coast-line,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
is an indication of the continued disuse of the
waters of the gulf as a means of communication. On
this supposition we may readily understand the difficulties
encountered by Sennacherib when transporting
his army across the head of the gulf against certain
coast-towns of Elam, and the necessity, to which he
was put, of building special ships for the purpose.</p>

<p>There is evidence that in the Neo-Babylonian period
the possibilities of transport by way of the gulf had
already begun to attract attention, and Nebuchadnezzar
II. is said to have attempted to build harbours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
in the swamp at the mouths of the delta.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But his
object must have been confined to encouraging coastal
trade, for the sea-route between the Persian Gulf and
India was certainly not in use before the fifth century,
and in all probability was inaugurated by Alexander.
According to Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> it had been opened by Darius
after the return of the Greek Scylax of Caryanda from
his journey to India, undertaken as one of the surveying
expeditions on the basis of which Darius founded the
assessment of his new satrapies. But, although there
is no need to doubt the historical character of that
voyage, there is little to suggest that Scylax coasted
round, or even entered, the Persian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Moreover,
it is clear that, while Babylon's international trade
received a great impetus under the efficient organization
of the Persian Empire, it was the overland routes which
benefited. The outcrops of rock, or cataracts, which
blocked the Tigris for vessels of deeper draft, were not
removed until Alexander levelled them; and the problem
of Babylon's sea-traffic, to which he devoted the closing
months of his life, was undoubtedly one of the factors
which, having now come into prominence for the first
time, influenced Seleucus in selecting a site on the
Tigris for his new capital.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>But that was not the only cause of Babylon's
deposition. For after her capture by Cyrus, new forces
came into play which favoured a transference of the
capital eastward. During the earlier periods of her
history Babylon's chief rival and most persistent enemy
had lain upon her eastern frontier. To the early
Sumerian rulers of city-states Elam had been "the
mountain that strikes terror,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and during subsequent
periods the cities of Sumer and Akkad could never be
sure of immunity from invasion in that quarter. We
shall see that in Elam the Western Semites of Babylon
found the chief obstacle to the southward extension of
their authority, and that in later periods any symptom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of internal weakness or dissension was the signal for
renewed attack. It is true that the Assyrian danger
drew these ancient foes together for a time, but even
the sack of Susa by Ashur-bani-pal did not put an end
to their commercial rivalry.</p>

<p>During all this period there was small temptation
to transfer the capital to any point within easier striking
distance of so powerful a neighbour; and with the
principal passes for eastward traffic under foreign control,
it was natural that the Euphrates route to Northern
Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean coast should
continue to be the chief outlet for Babylonian commerce.
But on the incorporation of the country within the
Persian empire all danger of interference with her
eastern trade was removed; and it is a testimony to the
part Babylon had already played in history that she
continued to be the capital city of Asia for more than
two centuries. Cyrus, like Alexander, entered the city
as a conqueror, but each was welcomed by the people
and their priests as the restorer of ancient rights and
privileges. Policy would thus have been against any
attempt to introduce radical innovations. The prestige
the city enjoyed and the grandeur of its temples and
palaces doubtless also weighed with the Achæmenian
kings in their choice of Babylon for their official
residence, except during the summer months. Then
they withdrew to the cooler climate of Persepolis
or Ecbatana, and during the early spring, too, they
might transfer the court to Susa; but they continued
to recognize Babylon as their true capital. In fact, the
city only lost its importance when the centre of government
was removed to Seleucia in its own immediate
neighbourhood. Then, at first possibly under compulsion,
and afterwards of their own freewill, the commercial
classes followed their rulers to the west bank of the
Tigris; and Babylon suffered in proportion. In the
swift rise of Seleucia in response to official orders, we
may see clear proof that the older city's influence had
been founded upon natural conditions, which were
shared in an equal, and now in even a greater degree, by
the site of the new capital.</p>

</div>

<p>The secret of Babylon's greatness is further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
illustrated by still later events in the valley of the
Euphrates and the Tigris. The rise of Ctesiphon on
the left bank of the river was a further result of the
eastward trend of commerce. But it lay immediately
opposite Seleucia, and marked no fresh shifting of
the centre of gravity. Of little importance under
the Seleucid rulers, it became the chief city of the
Arsacidæ, and, after the Parthian Empire had been
conquered by Ardashir I., it continued to be the
principal city of the province and became the winter
residence of the Sassanian kings. When in 636 A.D.
the Moslem invaders defeated the Persians near the
ruins of Babylon and in the following year captured
Ctesiphon, they found that city and Seleucia to which
they gave the joint name of Al-Madâin, or "the cities,"
still retaining the importance their site had acquired in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Then follows a period of a
hundred and twenty-five years which is peculiarly instructive
for comparison with the earlier epochs of
Babylonian history.</p>

<p>The last of the great Semitic migrations from
Arabia had resulted in the conquests of Islam, when,
after the death of Mohammed, the Arab armies
poured into Western Asia in their efforts to convert
the world to their faith. The course of the movement,
and its effect upon established civilizations which were
overthrown, may be traced in the full light of history;
and we find in the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates
a resultant economic condition which forms a close
parallel to that of the age before the rise of Babylon.
The military occupation of Mesopotamia by the Arabs
closed for a time the great avenues of transcontinental
commerce; and, as a result, the political control of the
country ceased to be exercised from the capital of the
Sassanian kings and was distributed over more than
one area. New towns sprang into being around the
permanent camps of the Arab armies. Following on
the conquest of Mesopotamia, the city of Basra was
built on the Shatt el-'Arab in the extreme south of the
country, while in the same year, 638 A.D., Kûfa was
founded more to the north-west on the desert side of
the Euphrates. A third great town, Wâsit, was added
sixty-five years later, and this arose in the centre of the
country on both banks of the Tigris, whose waters
were then passing along the present bed of the Shatt el-Hai.
It is true that Madâin retained a measure of
local importance, but during the Omayyad Caliphate
Kûfa and Basra were the twin capitals of 'Irâk.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Thus the slackening of international connections led
at once to a distribution of authority between a north
and a south Babylonian site. It is true that both
capitals were under the same political control, but from
the economic standpoint we are forcibly reminded of
the era of city-states in Sumer and Akkad. Then, too,
there was no external factor to retain the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
gravity in the north; and Erech more than once secured
the hegemony, while the most stable of the shifting
dynasties was the latest of the southern city of Ur.
The rise of Babylon as the sole and permanent capital
of Sumer and Akkad may be traced, as we shall note,
to increased relations with Northern Syria, which
followed the establishment of her dynasty of West-Semitic
kings.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> And again we may see history
repeating herself, when Moslem authority is removed
to Baghdad at the close of the first phase in the Arab
occupation of Mesopotamia. For on the fall of the
Omayyad dynasty and the transference of the Abbasid
capital from Damascus to the east, commercial intercourse
with Syria and the west was restored to its old
footing. Basra and Kûfa at once failed to respond to
the changed conditions, and a new administrative
centre was required. It is significant that Baghdad
should have been built a few miles above Ctesiphon,
within the small circle of the older capitals;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and that,
with the exception of a single short period,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> she should
have remained the capital city of 'Irâk. Thus the
history of Mesopotamia under the Caliphate is instructive
for the study of the closely parallel conditions
which enabled Babylon at a far earlier period to secure
the hegemony in Babylonia and afterwards to retain it.</p>

<p>From this brief survey of events it will have been
noted that Babylon's supremacy falls in the middle
period of her country's history, during which she
distributed a civilization in the origin of which she
played no part. When she passed, the culture she had
handed on passed with her, though on Mesopotamian
soil its decay was gradual. But she had already
delivered her message, and it has left its mark on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
remains of other races of antiquity which have come
down to us. We shall see that it was in three main
periods that her influence made itself felt in any marked
degree beyond the limits of the home-land. The earliest
of these periods of external contact was that of her
First Dynasty of West-Semitic rulers, though the most
striking evidence of its effect is only forthcoming after
some centuries had passed. In the second period the
process was indirect, her culture being carried north and
west by the expansion of Assyria. The last of the three
epochs coincides with the rule of the Neo-Babylonian
kings, when, thanks to her natural resources, the
country not only regained her independence, but for a
short time established an empire which far eclipsed her
earlier effort. And in spite of her speedy return, under
Persian rule, to the position of a subject province, her
foreign influence may be regarded as operative, it is true
in diminishing intensity, well into the Hellenic period.</p>

<p>The concluding chapter will deal in some detail
with certain features of Babylonian civilization, and with
the extent to which it may have moulded the cultural
development of other races. In the latter connexion
a series of claims has been put forward which cannot be
ignored in any treatment of the nation's history. Some
of the most interesting contributions that have recently
been made to Assyriologieal study undoubtedly concern
the influence of ideas, which earlier research had already
shown to be of Babylonian origin. Within recent years
a school has arisen in Germany which emphasizes the
part played by Babylon in the religious development
of Western Asia, and, in a minor degree, of Europe.
The evidence on which reliance has been placed to
prove the spread of Babylonian thought throughout the
ancient world has been furnished mainly by Israel and
Greece; and it is claimed that many features both in
Hebrew religion and in Greek mythology can only be
rightly studied in the light thrown upon them by
Babylonian parallels from which they were ultimately
derived. It will therefore be necessary to examine
briefly the theory which underlies most recent speculation
on this subject, and to ascertain, if possible, how far
it may be relied on to furnish results of permanent value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>But it will be obvious that, if the theory is to
be accepted in whole or in part, it must be shown to
rest upon a firm historical basis, and that any inquiry
into its credibility should be more fitly postponed until
the history of the nation itself has been passed in review.
After the evidence of actual contact with other races
has been established in detail, it will be possible to form
a more confident judgment upon questions which
depend for their solution solely on a balancing of
probabilities. The estimate of Babylon's foreign
influence has therefore been postponed to the closing
chapter of the volume. But before considering the
historical sequence of her dynasties, and the periods to
which they may be assigned, it will be well to inquire
what recent excavation has to tell us of the actual
remains of the city which became the permanent capital
of Babylonia.</p>

<h4>THE CITY OF BABYLON AND ITS REMAINS: A DISCUSSION
OF THE RECENT EXCAVATIONS</h4>


<p>The actual site of Babylon was never lost in
popular tradition. In spite of the total
disappearance of the city, which followed its
gradual decay under Seleucid and Parthian rule, its
ancient fame sufficed to keep it in continual remembrance.
The old Semitic name Bâb-ilî, "the Gate
of the Gods," lingered on about the site, and under the
form Babil is still the local designation for the most
northerly of the city-mounds. Tradition, too, never
ceased to connect the exposed brickwork of Nebuchadnezzar's
main citadel and palace with his name. Ḳaṣr,
the Arab name for the chief palace-mound and citadel
of Babylon, means "palace" or "castle," and when
in the twelfth century Benjamin of Tudela visited
Baghdad, the Jews of that city told him that in the
neighbouring ruins, near Hilla, the traveller might
still behold Nebuchadnezzar's palace beside the fiery
furnace into which Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah had
been thrown. It does not seem that this adventurous
rabbi actually visited the site,<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> though it is unlikely
that he was deterred by fear of the serpents and
scorpions with which, his informants said, the ruins
were infested.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century an English merchant
traveller, John Eldred, made three voyages to "New
Babylon," as he calls Baghdad, journeying from Aleppo
down the Euphrates. On the last occasion, after
describing his landing at Faluja, and how he secured a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
hundred asses for lack of camels to carry his goods to
Baghdad, he tells us that "in this place which we
crossed over stood the olde mightie citie of Babylon,
many olde ruines whereof are easilie to be scene by
daylight, which I, John Eldred, have often behelde at
my goode leisure having made three voyages between
the New Citie of Babylon and Aleppo over this
desert."<a name="FNanchor_2_18" id="FNanchor_2_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_18" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But it would seem probable from his further
description that "the olde tower of Babell," which he
visited "sundry times," was really the ruin of 'Akarkûf,
which he would have passed on his way to Baghdad.
Benjamin of Tudela, on the other hand, had taken
Birs-Nimrûd for the Tower of Babel,<a name="FNanchor_3_19" id="FNanchor_3_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_19" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and had noted
how the ruins of the streets of Babylon still extend
for thirty miles. In fact, it was natural that several
of the early travellers should have regarded the whole
complex of ruins, which they saw still standing
along their road to Baghdad, as parts of the ancient
city; and it is not surprising that some of the earlier
excavators should have fallen under a similar illusion so
far as the area between Bâbil and El-Birs is concerned.<a name="FNanchor_4_20" id="FNanchor_4_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_20" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The famous description of Herodotus, and the
accounts other classical writers have left us of the city's
size, tended to foster this conviction; and, although
the centre of Babylon was identified correctly enough,
the size of the city's area was greatly exaggerated.
Babylon had cast her spell upon mankind, and it has
taken sixteen years of patient and continuous excavation
to undermine that stubborn belief. But in the process
of shrinkage, and as accurate knowledge has gradually
given place to conjecture, the old spell has reappeared
unchanged. It may be worth while to examine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
some detail the results of recent work upon the site,
and note to what extent the city's remains have
thrown light upon its history while leaving some
problems still unsolved.</p>

<p>In view of the revolution in our knowledge of
Babylonian topography, which has been one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
most striking results of recent work, no practical
purpose would be served by tracing out the earlier
but very partial examinations of the site which were
undertaken successively by Rich in 1811,<a name="FNanchor_5_21" id="FNanchor_5_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_21" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> by Layard
in 1850,<a name="FNanchor_6_22" id="FNanchor_6_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_22" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> by Oppert as the head of a French expedition
in the years 1852-54,<a name="FNanchor_7_23" id="FNanchor_7_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_23" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and by Hormuzd Rassam,
between 1878 and 1889, when he was employed on
excavations for the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_8_24" id="FNanchor_8_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_24" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> During the
last of these periods the British Museum obtained a
valuable series of tablets from Babylon, some of the
texts proving of great literary and scientific interest.
In 1887, and again after a lapse of ten years, Dr. Robert
Koldewey visited the site of Babylon and picked up
fragments of enamelled bricks on the east side of the
Ḳaṣr. On the latter occasion he sent some of them to
Berlin, and Dr. Richard Schöne, at that time Director
of the Royal Museums, recognized their artistic and
archæological interest. Thus it was with the hope of
making speedy and startling discoveries that the
German Oriental Society began work upon the site at
the end of March in the year 1899; and it is the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to the credit of the excavators that they have not
allowed any difficulties or disappointments to curtail
and bring to a premature close the steady progress of
their research.</p>

<p>The extent of ground covered by the remains of the
ancient city, and the great accumulation of <i>débris</i> over
some of the principal buildings rendered the work more
arduous than was anticipated, and consequently the
publication of results has been delayed. It is true that,
from the very beginning of operations, the expert has
been kept informed of the general progress of the
digging by means of letters and reports distributed to
its subscribers every few months by the society.<a name="FNanchor_9_25" id="FNanchor_9_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_25" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> But
it was only in 1911, after twelve years of uninterrupted
digging, that the first instalment was issued of the
scientific publication. This was confined to the
temples of the city, and for the first time placed the
study of Babylonian religious architecture upon a
scientific basis.<a name="FNanchor_10_26" id="FNanchor_10_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_26" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In the following year Dr. Koldewey,
the director of the excavations, supplemented his first
volume with a second, in which, under pressure from
the society, he forestalled to some extent the future
issues of the detailed account by summarizing the
results obtained to date upon all sections of the site.<a name="FNanchor_11_27" id="FNanchor_11_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_27" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
It has thus been rendered possible to form a connected
idea of the remains of the ancient city, so far as they
have been recovered.</p>

<p>In their work at Babylon the excavators have, of
course, employed modern methods, which differ
considerably from those of the age when Layard and
Botta brought the winged bulls of Assyria to the
British Museum and to the Louvre. The extraordinary
success which attended those earlier excavators has,
indeed, never been surpassed. But it is now realized
that only by minuteness of search and by careful
classification of strata can the remains of the past be
made to reveal in full their secrets. The fine museum
specimen retains its importance; but it gains immensely
in significance when it ceases to be an isolated product
and takes its place in a detailed history of its period.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>


<p>In order to grasp the character of the new evidence,
and the methods by which it has been obtained at
Babylon, it is advisable to bear in mind some of the
general characteristics of Babylonian architecture and
the manner in which the art of building was influenced
by the natural conditions of the country. One
important point to realize is that the builders of all
periods were on the defensive, and not solely against
human foes, for in that aspect they resembled other
builders of antiquity. The foe they most dreaded was
Hood. Security against flood conditioned the architect's
ideal: he aimed solely at height and mass. When a
king built a palace for himself or a temple for his god,
he did not consciously aim at making it graceful or
beautiful. What he always boasts of having done is
that he has made it "like a mountain." He delighted
to raise the level of his artificial mound or building-platform,
and the modern excavator owes much to this
continual filling in of the remains of earlier structures.
The material at his disposal was also not without its
influence in the production of buildings "like
mountains," designed to escape the floods of the plain.</p>

<p>The alluvial origin of the Babylonian soil deprived
the inhabitants of an important factor in the development
of the builder's art: it produced for them no
stone. But it supplied a very effective building-material
in its place, a strongly adhesive clay. Throughout their
whole history the Babylonian architects built in crude
and in kiln-burnt brick. In the Neo-Babylonian period
we find them making interesting technical experiments
in this material, here a first attempt to roof in a wide
area with vaulting, elsewhere counteracting the effects
of settlement by a sort of expansion-joint. We shall
see, too, that it was in this same medium that they
attained to real beauty of design.</p>

<p>Brick continued to be the main building-material in
Assyria too, for that country derived its culture from
the lower Euphrates valley.<a name="FNanchor_12_28" id="FNanchor_12_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_28" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But in the north soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
limestone quarries were accessible. So in Assyria they
lined their mud-brick walls with slabs of limestone,
carved in low relief and brightly coloured; and they set
up huge stone colossi to flank their palace entrances.
This use of stone, both as a wall-lining and in wall-foundations,
constitutes the main difference between
Babylonian and Assyrian architectural design. Incidentally
it explains how the earlier excavators were so
much more successful in Assyria than in Babylonia;
for in both countries they drove their tunnels and
trenches into most of the larger mounds. They could
tunnel with perfect certainty when they had these stone
linings of the walls to guide them. But to follow out
the ground-plan of a building constructed only of
unburnt brick, with mud or clay for mortar, necessitates
a slower and more systematic process of examination.
For unburnt brick becomes welded into a solid
mass, scarcely to be distinguished from the surrounding
soil, and the lines of a building in this material can only
be recovered by complete excavation.</p>

<p>An idea of the labour this sometimes entails may be
gained from the work which preceded the identification
of E-sagila, the great temple of Marduk, the city-god of
Babylon. The temple lies at a depth of no less than
twenty-one metres below the upper level of the hill of
<i>débris</i>; and portions of two of its massive mud-brick
walls, together with the neighbouring pavements, were
uncovered by bodily removing the great depth of soil
truck by truck. But here even German patience and
thoroughness have been beaten, and tunnelling was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
eventually adopted to establish the outer limits of the
ground-plan, much of the interior of which still remains
unexplored.<a name="FNanchor_13_29" id="FNanchor_13_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_29" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Babylon which has now been partially cleared,
though in its central portion it reaches back to the
First Dynasty and to the period of Hammurabi, is
mainly that of the Neo-Babylonian empire, when Nebuchadnezzar
II., and Nabonidus, the last native Babylonian
king, raised their capital to a condition of magnificence
it had not known before. This city survived,
with but little change, during the domination of the
Achæmenian kings of Persia, and from the time of
Herodotus onward Babylon was made famous throughout
the ancient world. At that time Ashur and
Nineveh, the great capitals of Assyria, had ceased to
exist; but Babylon was still in her glory, and descriptions
of the city have come down to us in the works of
classical writers. To fit this literary tradition to the
actual remains of the city has furnished a number of
fascinating problems. How, for example, are we to
explain the puzzling discrepancy between the present
position of the outer walls and the enormous estimate
of the city's area given by Herodotus, or even that of
Ctesias? For Herodotus himself appears to have
visited Babylon; and Ctesias was the physician of
Artaxerxes II. Mnemon, who has left a memorial of
his presence in a marble building on the Ḳaṣr.</p>

<p>Herodotus reckons that the walls of Babylon
extended for four hundred and eighty stades, the area
they enclosed forming an exact square, a hundred and
twenty stades in length each way.<a name="FNanchor_14_30" id="FNanchor_14_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_30" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In other words, he
would have us picture a city more than fifty-three miles
in circumference. The estimate of Ctesias is not so
large, his side of sixty-five stades giving a circumference
of rather over forty miles.<a name="FNanchor_15_31" id="FNanchor_15_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_31" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Such figures, it has been
suggested, are not in themselves impossible, Koldewey,
for example, comparing the Great Wall of China
which extends for more than fifteen hundred miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and is thus about twenty-nine times as long as Herodotus's
estimate for the wall of Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_16_32" id="FNanchor_16_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_32" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But the
latter was not simply a frontier-fortification. It was
the enclosing wall of a city, and a more apposite
comparison is that of the walls of Nanking, the largest
city-site in China, and the work of an empire even
greater than Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_17_33" id="FNanchor_17_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_33" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The latter measure less than
twenty-four miles in circuit, and the comparison does
not encourage an acceptance of Herodotus's figures on
grounds of general probability. It is true that Oppert
accepted them, but he only found this possible by
stretching his plan of the city to include the whole area
from Babil to Birs-Nimrûd,<a name="FNanchor_18_34" id="FNanchor_18_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_34" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and by seeing traces of
the city and its walls in every sort of intervening mound
of whatever period.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact part of the great wall, which
surrounded the city from the Neo-Babylonian period
onward, has survived to the present day, and may still
be recognized in a low ridge of earth, or series of consecutive
mounds,<a name="FNanchor_19_35" id="FNanchor_19_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_35" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which cross the plain for a considerable
distance to the south-east of Babil. The traveller
from Baghdad, after crossing the present Nîl Canal by
a bridge,<a name="FNanchor_20_36" id="FNanchor_20_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_36" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> passes through a gap in the north-eastern wall
before he sees on his right the isolated mound of Bâbil
with the extensive complex of the Ḳaṣr and its neighbour,
Tell 'Amrân-ibn-'Ali, stretching away in front
and to his left.<a name="FNanchor_21_37" id="FNanchor_21_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_37" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The whole length of the city-wall,
along the north-east side, may still be traced by the
position of these low earthen mounds, and they prove
that the city on this side measured not quite two and
three-quarter miles in extent. The eastern angle of the
wall is also preserved, and the south-east wall may be
followed for another mile and a quarter as it doubles
back towards the Euphrates. These two walls, together
with the Euphrates, enclose the only portion of the
ancient city on which ruins of any importance still
exist. But, according to Herodotus and other writers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the city was enclosed by two similar walls upon the western
bank, in which case the site it occupied must
have formed a rough quadrangle, divided diagonally by
the river. No certain trace has yet been recovered of
the western walls,<a name="FNanchor_22_38" id="FNanchor_22_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_38" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and all remains of buildings seem to
have disappeared completely on that side of the river.
But for the moment it may be assumed that the city
did occupy approximately an equal amount of space
upon the western bank; and, even so, its complete
circuit would not have extended for more than about
eleven miles, a figure very far short of any of those

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Dr. Koldewey suggests that, as the estimate of
Ctesias approximates to four times the correct measurement,
we may suspect that he mistook the figure which
applies to the whole circumference for the measure of
one side only of the square. But even if we accept that
solution, it leaves the still larger figure of Herodotus
unexplained. It is preferable to regard all such estimates
of size, not as based on accurate measurements,
but merely as representing an impression of grandeur
produced on the mind of their recorder, whether by a
visit to the city itself, or by reports of its magnificence
at second-hand.</p>

<p>The excavators have not as yet devoted much
attention to the city-wall, and, until more extensive
digging has been carried out, it will not be possible to
form a very detailed idea of the system of fortification.
But enough has already been done to prove that the
outer wall was a very massive structure, and consisted
of two separate walls with the intermediate space filled
in with rubble. The outer wall, or face, which bore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
brunt of any attack and rose high above the moat
encircling the city, was of burnt brick set in bitumen.
It measured more than seven metres in thickness, and
below ground-level was further protected from the
waters of the moat by an additional wall, more than
three metres in thickness, and, like it, constructed
of burnt brick with bitumen as mortar. Behind the
outer wall, at a distance of some twelve metres from it, was
a second wall of nearly the same thickness. This faced
inward towards the city, and so was constructed of
crude or unburnt brick, as it would not be liable to
direct assault by a besieger; and the mortar employed
was clay.<a name="FNanchor_23_39" id="FNanchor_23_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_39" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The crude-brick wall cannot be dated
accurately, but it is certainly older than the reign of
Nebuchadnezzar, and in his father's time it probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
formed the outer city's sole protection.<a name="FNanchor_24_40" id="FNanchor_24_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_40" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The burnt-brick
wall and the moat-lining in front of it date, in
their present form, from the age of Nebuchadnezzar, for
they are built of his square bricks, impressed with his
usual stamp, which are so common over the whole site
of Babylon.</p>

<p class="caption">(After Koldewey and Andrae.)</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">At intervals along the crude-brick wall were towers
projecting slightly beyond each face.<a name="FNanchor_25_41" id="FNanchor_25_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_41" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Only the bases
of the towers have been preserved, so that any restoration
of their upper structure must rest on pure conjecture.
But, as rubble still fills the space between the
two walls of burnt and unburnt brick, it may be
presumed that the filling was continued up to the crown
of the outer wall. It is possible that the inner wall of
crude brick was raised to a greater height and formed
a curtain between each pair of towers. But even so,
the clear space in front, consisting of the rubble filling
and the burnt-brick wall, formed a broad roadway
nearly twenty metres in breadth, which extended right
round the city along the top of the wall. On this point
the excavations have fully substantiated the account
given by Herodotus, who states that "on the top,
along the edges of the wall, they constructed buildings
of a single chamber facing one another, leaving between
them room for a four-horse chariot to turn."<a name="FNanchor_26_42" id="FNanchor_26_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_42" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Even if
smaller towers were built upon the outer edge, there
would have been fully enough space to drive a team of
four horses abreast along the wall, and in the intervals
between the towers two such chariots might easily
have passed each other. It has been acutely noted that
this design of the wall was not only of protection by
reason of its size, but was also of great strategic value;
for it enabled the defence to move its forces with great
speed from one point to another, wherever the attack
at the moment might be pressed.<a name="FNanchor_27_43" id="FNanchor_27_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_43" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact it is only in the matter of size and extent
that the description given by Herodotus of the walls of
Babylon is to be discounted; and those are just the
sort of details that an ancient traveller would accept
without question from his local guide. His total
number for the city-gates is also no doubt excessive,<a name="FNanchor_28_44" id="FNanchor_28_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_44" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but
his description of the wall itself as built of burnt-brick
tallies exactly with the construction of its outer face,
which would have been the only portion visible to
any one passing outside the city. Moreover, in one
portion of the wall, as reconstructed by Nebuchadnezzar,
its inner as well as its outer half appears to have been
formed of burnt-brick. This is the small rectangular
extension, which Nebuchadnezzar threw out to protect
his later citadel now covered by the mound known as
Babil.<a name="FNanchor_29_45" id="FNanchor_29_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_45" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The mound of Babil represents Nebuchadnezzar's
latest addition to the city's system of fortification, and
its construction in advance of the old line of the outer
walls was dictated by the desire, of which we find
increasing evidence throughout his reign, to strengthen
the capital against attack from the north. The mound
has not yet been systematically excavated, but
enough has been done to prove that, like the great
citadel upon the Ḳaṣr, it protected a royal palace
consisting of a large number of chambers and galleries
grouped around open courts. From this fact it is clear
that a Babylonian citadel was not simply a fortress to
be used by the garrison for the defence of the city as a
whole: it was also a royal residence, into which the
monarch and his court could shut themselves for safety
should the outer wall of the city itself be penetrated.
Even in times of peace the king dwelt there, and the
royal stores and treasury, as well as the national
armoury and arsenal, were housed in its innumerable
magazines. In the case of the Southern Citadel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Babylon, on which excavations have now been continuously
carried out for sixteen years, we shall see
that it formed a veritable township in itself. It was a
city within a city, a second Babylon in miniature.<a name="FNanchor_30_46" id="FNanchor_30_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_46" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The Southern or chief Citadel was built on the
mound now known as the Ḳaṣr, and within it Nebuchadnezzar
erected his principal palace, partly over an earlier
building of his father Nabopolassar. The palace and
citadel occupy the old city-square or centre of Babylon,
which is referred to in the inscriptions as the <i>irsit
Babili,</i> "the Bâbil place."<a name="FNanchor_31_47" id="FNanchor_31_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_47" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Though far smaller in
extent than Nebuchadnezzar's citadel, we may conclude
that the chief fortress of Babylon always stood upon
this site, and the city may well have derived its name
Bâb-ilî, "the Gate of the Gods," from the strategic
position of its ancient fortress, commanding as it does,
the main approach to E-sagila, the famous temple of
the city-god.<a name="FNanchor_32_48" id="FNanchor_32_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_48" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The earliest ruins in Babylon, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
date from the age of Hammurabi and the First Dynasty
of West-Semitic kings, lie under the mound of Merkes<a name="FNanchor_33_49" id="FNanchor_33_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_49" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
just to the east of E-sagila and the Tower of Babylon,
proving that the first capital clustered about the shrine
of the city-god. The streets in that quarter suffered
but little change, and their main lines remained unaltered
down through the Kassite period into Neo-Babylonian
and later times.<a name="FNanchor_34_50" id="FNanchor_34_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_50" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It was natural that even
in the earlier period the citadel should have been
planted up-stream, to the north of city and temple,
since the greatest danger of invasion was always from
the north.</p>

<p class="caption2">The view is reconstructed from the north, the conventional mound in the
foreground covering the Central Citadel now partially excavated. The Sacred
Road passes through the Ishtar Gate and along the east side of the palace;
further to the east and within the fortifications is the small temple of Ninmakh.
The innermost wall encloses the palace of Nebuchadnezzar with its four open
courts; the façade of the Throne Room, with three entrances, is visible in the
Great Court. The flat roofs of the palace are broken here and there by smaller
courts or light-wells. Compare the ground-plan on p. 30, Fig. 6.</p>

<p class="caption">(After Andrae.)</p>

<p class="p2">The outer city-wall, already described, dates only
from the Neo-Babylonian period, when the earlier and
smaller city expanded with the prosperity which
followed the victories of Nabopolassar and his son.
The eastern limits of that earlier city, at any rate toward
the close of the Assyrian domination, did not
extend beyond the inner wall, which was then the only
line of defence and was directly connected with the
main citadel. The course of the inner wall may still
be traced for a length of seventeen hundred metres by
the low ridge or embankment,<a name="FNanchor_35_51" id="FNanchor_35_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_51" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> running approximately
north and south, from a point north-east of the mound
Homera.<a name="FNanchor_36_52" id="FNanchor_36_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_52" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It was a double fortification, consisting of
two walls of crude or unburnt brick, with a space
between of rather more than seven metres. The thicker
of the walls, on the west, which is six and a half metres
in breadth, has large towers built across it, projecting
deeply on the outer side, and alternating with smaller
towers placed lengthwise along it. The outer or
eastern wall has smaller towers at regular intervals.
Now along the north side of the main or Southern
Citadel run a pair of very similar walls,<a name="FNanchor_37_53" id="FNanchor_37_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_53" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> also of crude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
brick, and they are continued eastward of the citadel to
a point where, in the Persian period, the Euphrates
through a change of course destroyed all further trace
of them.<a name="FNanchor_38_54" id="FNanchor_38_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_54" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> We may confidently assume that in the
time of Nebuchadnezzar<a name="FNanchor_39_55" id="FNanchor_39_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_55" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> they were linked up with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
inner city-wall to the north of Homeni and formed
its continuation after it turned at right angles on its
way towards the river-bank. This line of fortification
is of considerable interest, as there is reason to believe
it may represent the famous double-line of Babylon's
defences, which is referred to again and again in the
inscriptions.</p>

<p class="p2">The two names the Babylonians gave these walls
were suggested by their gratitude to and confidence in
Marduk, the city-god, who for them was the "Bêl," or
Lord, <i>par excellence.</i> To the greater of the two, the
<i>dûru</i> or inner wall, they gave the name <i>Imgur-Bêl,</i>
meaning "Bêl has been gracious"; while the <i>shaikhu,</i>
or outer one, they called <i>Nimitti-Bêl,</i> that is, probably,
"The foundation of Bêl," or "My foundation is Bêl."<a name="FNanchor_40_56" id="FNanchor_40_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_56" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
The identification of at least one of the crude-brick
walls near Homera with Nimitti-Bêl, has been definitely
proved by several foundation-cylinders of Ashur-bani-pal,
the famous Assyrian king who deposed his brother
Shamash-shum-ukîn from the throne of Babylon and
annexed the country as a province of Assyria.<a name="FNanchor_41_57" id="FNanchor_41_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_57" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> On
the cylinders he states that the walls Imgur-Bêl and
Nimitti-Bêl had fallen into ruins, and he records his
restoration of the latter, within the foundation or
structure of which the cylinders were originally
immured. Unfortunately they were not found in
place, but among the <i>débris</i> in the space between the
walls, so that it is not now certain from which wall
they came. If they had been deposited in the thicker
or inner wall, then Nimitti-Bêl must have been a
double line of fortification, and both walls together
must have borne the name; and in that case we
must seek elsewhere for Imgur-Bêl. But it is equally
possible that they came from the narrow or outer
wall; and on this alternative Nimitti-Bêl may be the
outer one and Imgur-Bêl the broader inner-wall with
the widely projecting towers. It is true that only
further excavation can settle the point; but meanwhile
the fortifications on the Ḳaṣr have supplied further
evidence which seems to support the latter view.</p>

</div>


<p>The extensive alterations which took place in the
old citadel's fortifications, especially during Nebuchadnezzar's
long reign of forty-three years, led to the
continual dismantling of earlier structures and the
enlargement of the area enclosed upon the north
and west. This is particularly apparent in its north-west
corner. Here, at a considerable depth below
the later fortification-walls,
were
found the remains
of four earlier
walls,<a name="FNanchor_42_58" id="FNanchor_42_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_58" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> the discovery
of which
has thrown considerable
light on
the topography of
this portion of
Babylon. All four
are ancient quay-walls,
their northern
and western
faces sloping
sharply inwards as
they rise. Each
represents a fresh
rebuilding of the
quay, as it was
gradually extended
to the north and
west. Fortunately,
stamped and inscribed
bricks were
employed in considerable quantities in their construction,
so that it is possible to date the periods of
rebuilding accurately.</p>

<p>The earliest of the quay-walls, which is also the
earliest building yet recovered on the Ḳaṣr, is the most
massive of the four,<a name="FNanchor_43_59" id="FNanchor_43_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_59" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and is strengthened at the angle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
with a projecting circular bastion. It is the work of
Sargon of Assyria,<a name="FNanchor_44_60" id="FNanchor_44_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_60" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> who states the object of the
structure in a text inscribed upon several of its bricks.
After reciting his own name and titles, he declares
that it was his desire to rebuild Imgur-Bêl; that with
this object he caused burnt-bricks to be fashioned, and
built a quay-wall with pitch and bitumen in the depth
of the water from beside the Ishtar Gate to the bank
of the Euphrates; and he adds that he "founded
Imgur-Bêl and Nimitti-Bêl mountain-high upon it."<a name="FNanchor_45_61" id="FNanchor_45_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_61" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
The two walls of Sargon, which he here definitely
names as Imgur-Bêl and Nimitti-Bêl, were probably
of crude brick, and were, no doubt, demolished and
replaced by the later structures of Nabopolassar's and
Nebuchadnezzar's reigns. But they must have occupied
approximately the same position as the two crude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
brick walls above the quay of Sargon,<a name="FNanchor_46_62" id="FNanchor_46_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_62" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which run from
the old bank of the Euphrates to the Ishtar Gate,
precisely the two points mentioned in Sargon's text.
His evidence is therefore strongly in favour of identifying
these later crude-brick walls, which we have
already connected with the inner city-wall, as the
direct successors of his Imgur-Bêl and his Nimitti-Bêl,
and therefore as inheritors of the ancient names.</p>

<p class="caption">(After Andrae.)</p>
</div>

<p>We find further confirmation of this view in one
of the later quay-walls, which succeeded that of Sargon.
The three narrow walls already referred to<a name="FNanchor_47_63" id="FNanchor_47_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_63" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> were all
the work of Nabopolassar, and represent three successive
extensions of the quay westward into the bed
of the stream, which in the inscriptions upon their
bricks is given the name of Arakhtu.<a name="FNanchor_48_64" id="FNanchor_48_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_64" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> But the texts
make no mention of the city-walls. No inscriptions
at all have been found in the structure of the next
extension, represented by the wall B, which, like
the latest quay-wall (C), is not rounded off in the
earlier manner, but is strengthened at the corner with
a massive rectangular bastion. It was in this latest
and most substantial of all the quay-walls that further
inscriptions were found referring to Imgur-Bêl. They
prove that this wall was the work of Nebuchadnezzar,
who refers in them to Nabopolassar's restoration of
Imgur-Bêl and records that he raised its banks with
bitumen and burnt-brick mountain-high. It is therefore
clear that this was the quay-wall of Imgur Bêl,
which it supported in the manner of Sargon's earlier
structure. That the less important Nimitti-Bêl is not
mentioned in these texts does not necessitate our placing
it elsewhere, in view of Sargon's earlier reference.</p>

<p>We may therefore provisionally regard the two
crude-brick walls along the Ḳaṣr's northern front<a name="FNanchor_49_65" id="FNanchor_49_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_65" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> as
a section of the famous defences of Babylon, and picture
them as running eastward till they meet the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
city-wall by Homera. The point at which they
extended westward across the Euphrates can, as yet,
only be conjectured. But it is significant that the
angle of the western walls, which may still be traced
under mounds to the north of Sinjar village,<a name="FNanchor_50_66" id="FNanchor_50_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_66" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> is
approximately in line with the north front of the
Ḳaṣr and the end of the inner wall by Homera.
Including these western walls within our scheme, the
earlier Babylon would have been rectangular in ground-plan,
about a quarter of it only upon the right bank,
and the portion east of the river forming approximately
a square. The Babylon of the Kassite period and of the
First Dynasty must have been smaller still, its area covering
little more than the three principal mounds; and,
though part of its street net-work has been recovered, no
trace of its fortifications has apparently survived.</p>

<p>The evidence relating to the city's walls and
fortifications has been summarized rather fully, as it has
furnished the chief subject of controversy in connexion
with the excavations. It should be added that the view
suggested above is not shared by Dr. Koldewey, whose
objections to the proposed identification of Imgur-Bêl
rest on his interpretation of two phrases in a cylinder
of Nabopolassar, which was found out of place in <i>débris</i>
close to the east wall of the Southern Citadel. In it
Nabopolassar records his own restoration of Imgur-Bêl,
which he tells us had fallen into decay, and he states that
he "founded it in the primæval abyss," adding the
words, "I caused Babylon to be enclosed with it towards
the four winds."<a name="FNanchor_51_67" id="FNanchor_51_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_67" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> From the reference to the abyss,
Dr. Koldewey concludes that it had deep foundations,
and must therefore have been constructed of burnt, not
crude, brick; while from the second phrase he correctly
infers that it must have formed a quadrilateral closed on
all sides. But that, as we have seen, is precisely the
ground-plan we obtain by including the remains of
walls west of the river. And, in view of the well-known
tendency to exaggeration in these Neo-Babylonian
records, we should surely not credit any single metaphor
with the accuracy of a modern architect's specification.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
If a single section of the wall had been furnished, during
restoration, with a burnt-brick substructure, it would
have been enough to justify the royal claim.</p>

<p>The manner in which the Euphrates was utilized for
the defence and water-supply of the citadel has also been
illustrated by the excavations. The discovery of Sargon's
inscriptions proved that in his day the river flowed along
the western face of his quay-wall;<a name="FNanchor_52_68" id="FNanchor_52_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_68" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> while the inscriptions
on bricks from the three successive quay-walls of
Nabopolassar<a name="FNanchor_53_69" id="FNanchor_53_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_69" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> state, in each case, that he used them to
rebuild the wall of a channel he calls the "Arakhtu,"
using the name in precisely the same way as Sargon
refers to the Euphrates. The simplest explanation is
that in Nabopolassar's time the Arakhtu was the name
for that section of the Euphrates which washed the
western side of the citadel, and that its use in any case
included the portion of the citadel-moat, or canal, along
its northern face, which formed a basin opening directly
upon the river.<a name="FNanchor_54_70" id="FNanchor_54_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_70" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The "Arakhtu" may thus have been
a general term, not only for this basin, but for the
whole water-front from the north-west corner of the
citadel to some point on the left bank to the south of it.
It may perhaps have been further extended to include
the river frontage of the Tower of Babylon, since it was
into the Arakhtu that Sennacherib cast the tower on
his destruction of the city. Within this stretch of
water, particularly along the northern quays, vessels and
<i>keleks</i> would have been moored which arrived down
stream with supplies for the palace and the garrison.
The Arakhtu, in fact, may well have been the name for
the ancient harbour or dock of Babylon.</p>

<p>Some idea of the appearance of the quays may be
gathered from the right-hand corner of the restoration
in Fig. 5.<a name="FNanchor_55_71" id="FNanchor_55_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_71" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It is true that the outer quay-wall appears
to have been built to replace the inner one, while in the
illustration both are shown. But since the height of the
citadel and of its walls was continually being raised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the arrangement there suggested is by no means
impossible. But in the later part of his reign Nebuchadnezzar
changed the aspect of the river-front entirely.
To the west of the quay-walls, in the bed of the river, he
threw out a massive fortification with immensely thick
walls, from twenty to twenty-five metres in breadth.<a name="FNanchor_56_72" id="FNanchor_56_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_72" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
It was constructed entirely of burnt-brick and bitumen,
and, from his reference to it in an inscription from
Sippar, it would seem that his object in building it
was to prevent the formation of sandbanks in the river,
which in the past may have caused the flooding of the
left bank above E-Sagila.<a name="FNanchor_57_73" id="FNanchor_57_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_73" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> A narrow channel<a name="FNanchor_58_74" id="FNanchor_58_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_74" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> was left
between it and the old quay, along which the river water
continued to flow through gratings. This no doubt acted
as an overflow for the old northern moat of the citadel,
since the latter fed the supply-canal, which passed round
the palace and may still be traced along its south side.<a name="FNanchor_59_75" id="FNanchor_59_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_75" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
It is possible that the subsequent change in the
course of the Euphrates may be traced in part to this
huge river-fortification. Its massive structure suggests
that it had to withstand considerable water-pressure,
and it may well have increased any tendency of the
stream to break away eastward. However that may be,
it is certain that for a considerable time during the
Persian and Seleucid periods it flowed round to the
eastward of the Ḳaṣr, close under three sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
citadel and rejoined its former bed to the north of
Marduk's temple and the Tower of Babylon. Its course
east of the Ishtar Gate is marked by a late embankment
sloping outwards, which supported the thicker of
the crude-brick walls at the point where they suddenly
break off.<a name="FNanchor_60_76" id="FNanchor_60_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_76" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Beyond this embankment only mud and
river sediment were found. The water-course to the
south of the citadel is probably the point where the river
turned again towards the channel it had deserted. A
trench that was dug here showed that the present soil
is formed of silt deposited by water, and beyond the
remains of the earlier canal no trace of any building
was recovered. This temporary change in the river's
course, which the excavations have definitely proved,
explains another puzzle presented by the classical
tradition&mdash;the striking discrepancy between the actual
position of the principal ruins of Babylon in relation to
the river and their recorded position in the Persian
period. Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_61_77" id="FNanchor_61_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_77" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> for example, places the fortress
with the palace of the kings (that is, the Ḳaṣr), on the
opposite bank to the sacred precinct of Zeus Belus
(that is, E-temen-anki, the Tower of Babylon). But we
have now obtained proof that they were separated at
that time by the Euphrates, until the river returned
to its former and present bed, probably before the close
of the Seleucid period.</p>

<p>The greater part of the Southern Citadel is
occupied by the enormous palace on which Nebuchadnezzar
lavished his energies during so many years
of his reign. On ascending the throne of Babylon, he
found the ancient fortress a very different place to the
huge structure he bequeathed to his successors. He
had lived there in his father's life-time, but Nabopolassar
had been content with a comparatively modest
dwelling. And when his son, flushed with his victory
over the hosts of Egypt, returned to Babylon to take
the hands of Bêl, he began to plan a palace that should
be worthy of the empire he had secured. Of the old
palace of Nabopolassar, in which at first he was obliged
to dwell, very little now remains. What is left of it
constitutes the earliest building of which traces now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
exist within the palace area. Nebuchadnezzar describes
it, before his own building operations, as extending
from the Euphrates eastward to the Sacred Road;
and the old palace-enclosure undoubtedly occupied
that site. Traces of the old fortification-wall have
been found below the east front of the later palace, and
the arched doorway which gave access to its open
court, afterwards filled up and built over by Nebuchadnezzar,
has been found in a perfect state of preservation.<a name="FNanchor_62_78" id="FNanchor_62_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_78" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p class="caption">III. The Throne Room in Nebuchadnezzar's palace at Babylon,

</div>

<p>The old palace itself<a name="FNanchor_63_79" id="FNanchor_63_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_79" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> did not reach beyond the
western side of Nebuchadnezzar's great court.<a name="FNanchor_64_80" id="FNanchor_64_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_80" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The
upper structure, as we learn from the East India House
Inscription,<a name="FNanchor_65_81" id="FNanchor_65_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_81" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> was of crude brick, which was demolished
for the later building. But Nabopolassar, following a
custom which had survived unchanged from the time of
Hammurabi, had placed his crude-brick walls upon
burnt-brick foundations. These his son made use of,
simply strengthening them before erecting his own
walls upon them. Thus this section of the new palace
retained the old ground-plan to a great extent unchanged.
The strength and size of its walls are remarkable
and may in part be explained by the crude-brick
upper structure of the earlier building, which necessarily
demanded a broader base for its walls.</p>

<p>When Nebuchadnezzar began building he dwelt in
the old palace, while he strengthened the walls of its
open court on the east and raised its level for the solid
platform on which his own palace was to rise.<a name="FNanchor_66_82" id="FNanchor_66_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_82" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> For a
time the new and the old palace were connected by two
ramps of unburnt-brick,<a name="FNanchor_67_83" id="FNanchor_67_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_83" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> which were afterwards filled
in below the later pavement of the great court; and
we may picture the king ascending the ramps with his
architect on his daily inspection of the work. As soon
as the new palace on the east was ready he moved into
it, and, having demolished the old one, he built up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
own walls upon its foundations, and filled in the intermediate
spaces with earth and rubble until he raised its
pavement to the eastern level. Still later he built out
a further extension<a name="FNanchor_68_84" id="FNanchor_68_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_84" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> along its western side. In the
account he has left us of the palace-building the king
says: "I laid firm its foundation and raised it mountain-high
with bitumen and burnt-brick. Mighty cedars I
caused to be stretched out at length for its roofing. Door-leaves
of cedar overlaid with copper, thresholds and
sockets of bronze I placed in its doorways. Silver and
gold and precious stones, all that can be imagined of
costliness, splendour, wealth, riches, all that was highly
esteemed, I heaped up within it, I stored up immense
abundance of royal treasure therein."<a name="FNanchor_69_85" id="FNanchor_69_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_85" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>A good general idea of the palace ground-plan, in its
final form, may be obtained from Fig. 6. The main
entrance was in its eastern front, through a gate-way,<a name="FNanchor_70_86" id="FNanchor_70_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_86" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
flanked on its outer side by towers, and known as the
Bûb Bêlti, or "Lady Gate," no doubt from its proximity
to the temple of the goddess Ninmakh.<a name="FNanchor_71_87" id="FNanchor_71_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_87" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The
gate-house consists of an entrance hall, with rooms
opening at the sides for the use of the palace-guard.
The eastern part of the palace is built to the north and
south of three great open courts,<a name="FNanchor_72_88" id="FNanchor_72_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_88" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> separated from each
other by gateways<a name="FNanchor_73_89" id="FNanchor_73_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_89" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> very like that at the main entrance
to the palace. It will be noticed that, unlike the
arrangement of a European dwelling, the larger rooms
are always placed on the south side of the court facing
to the north, for in the sub-tropical climate of Babylonia
the heat of the summer sun was not courted, and these
chambers would have been in the shade throughout
almost the whole of the day.</p>

<p>Some of the larger apartments, including possibly
the chambers of the inner gateways, must have served
as courts of justice, for from the Hammurabi period
onward we know that the royal palace was the resort
of litigants, whose appeals in the earlier period were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
settled by the king himself,<a name="FNanchor_74_90" id="FNanchor_74_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_90" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and later by the judges
under his supervision. Every kind of commercial business
was carried on within the palace precincts, and not
only were regular lawsuits tried, but any transaction
that required legal attestation was most conveniently
carried through there. Proof of this may be seen
in the fact that so many of the Neo-Babylonian
contracts that have been recovered on the site of
Babylon are dated from the Al-Bît-shar-Bâbili, "the
City of the King of Babylon's dwelling," doubtless
a general title for the citadel and palace-area. All
government business was also transacted here, and
we may provisionally assign to the higher ministers
and officials of the court the great apartment and the
adjoining dwellings on the south side of the Central
Court of the palace.<a name="FNanchor_75_91" id="FNanchor_75_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_91" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> For many of the more important
officers in the king's service were doubtless housed on
the premises; and to those of lower rank we may
assign the similar but rather smaller dwellings, which
flank the three courts on the north and the Entrance
Court upon the south side as well. Even royal manufactories
were carried on within the palace, to judge
from the large number of alabaster jars, found beside
their cylindrical cores, in one room in the south-west
corner by the outer palace-wall.<a name="FNanchor_76_92" id="FNanchor_76_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_92" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>It will be seen from the ground-plan that these
dwellings consist of rooms built around open courts
or light-wells; most of them are separate dwellings,
isolated from their neighbours, and having doors opening
on to the greater courts or into passage-ways running
up from them. No trace of any windows has been
found within the buildings, and it is probable that they
were very sparsely employed. But we must not conclude
that they were never used, since no wall of the
palace has been preserved for more than a few feet
in height, and, for the greater part, their foundations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
only have survived. But there is no doubt that, like
the modern houses of the country, all the dwellings,
whether in palace or city, had flat roofs, which formed
the natural sleeping-place for their inhabitants during the
greater part of the year. Towards sunset, when the heat
of the day was past, they would ascend to the house-tops
to enjoy the evening breeze; during the day a
window would have been merely a further inlet for
the sun. The general appearance of the palace is
no doubt accurately
rendered in the
sketch already
given.<a name="FNanchor_77_93" id="FNanchor_77_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_93" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The most interesting
apartment
within the palace
is one that may be
identified as Nebuchadnezzar's
Throne
Room. This is the
room immediately
to the south of the
Great Court.<a name="FNanchor_78_94" id="FNanchor_78_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_94" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> It is
the largest chamber
of the palace, and
since the walls on
the longer sides are
six metres thick, far
broader than those
at the ends, it is
possible that they supported a barrel-vaulting. It has
three entrances from the court,<a name="FNanchor_79_95" id="FNanchor_79_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_95" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and in the back
wall opposite the centre one is a broad niche, doubly
recessed into the structure of the wall, where we may
assume the royal throne once stood. During any elaborate
court ceremony the king would thus have been
visible upon his throne, not only to those within the
chamber, but also from the central portion of the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Court. It was in this portion of the palace that some
traces of the later Babylonian methods of mural decoration
were discovered. For, while the inner walls of
the Throne Room were merely washed over with a
plaster of white gypsum, the brickwork of the outer
façade, which faced the court, was decorated with
brightly-coloured enamels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Only fragments of the enamelled surface were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
discovered, but these sufficed to restore the scheme of
decoration. A series of yellow columns with bright
blue capitals, both edged with white borders, stand
out against a dark blue ground. The capitals are the
most striking feature of the composition. Each consists
of two sets of double volutes, one above the
other, and a white rosette with yellow centre comes
partly into sight above them. Between each member
is a bud in sheath, forming a trefoil, and linking the
volutes of the capitals by means of light blue bands
which fall in a shallow curve from either side of it.
Still higher on the wall ran a frieze of double palmettes
in similar colouring, between yellow line-borders, the
centres of the latter picked out with lozenges coloured
black and yellow, and black and white, alternately.
The rich effect of this enamelled façade of the Throne
Room was enhanced by the decoration of the court
gateway, the surface of which was adorned in a like
fashion with figures of lions. So too were the gateways
of the other eastern courts, to judge from the
fragments of enamel found there, but the rest of the
court-walls were left undecorated or, perhaps, merely
received a coat of plaster. The fact that the interior
of the Throne Room, like the rest of the chambers of
the palace, was without ornamentation of any sort favours
the view that heat, and light with it, was deliberately
excluded by the absence of windows in the walls.</p>

<p>The chambers behind the Throne Room, reached
by two doorways in the back wall,<a name="FNanchor_80_96" id="FNanchor_80_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_96" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> were evidently for
the king's service, and are ranged around three open
courts; and in the south-west corners of two of them,
which lie immediately behind the Throne Room wall,
are wells, their positions indicated on the plan by
small open circles. The walls of each of these small
chambers are carried down through the foundations
to water-level, and the intermediate space is filled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
around the wells with rubble-packing. This device
was evidently adopted to secure an absolutely pure
supply of water for the royal table. But the private
part of the palace, occupied by the women and the
rest of the royal household, was evidently further to
the west, built over the earlier dwelling of Nabopolassar.
It will be seen from the ground-plan that this
is quite distinct from the eastern or official portion of
the palace, from which it is separated by a substantial
wall and passage-way running, with the Great Court,
the whole width of the palace-area. The character
of the gateway-building, which formed its chief
entrance and opened on the Great Court, is also significant.<a name="FNanchor_81_97" id="FNanchor_81_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_97" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
For the towers, flanking the gateways to the
official courts, are here entirely absent, and the pathway
passes through two successive apartments, the second
smaller than the first and with a porters' service-room
opening off it. The entrance for the king's own use
was in the southern half of the passage-way, and lies
immediately between the side entrance to the Throne
Room<a name="FNanchor_82_98" id="FNanchor_82_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_98" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and another doorway in the passage leading
to one of the small courts behind it.<a name="FNanchor_83_99" id="FNanchor_83_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_99" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> In two of the
chambers within the private palace, both opening on to
Court 5, are two more circular wells, walled in for protection,
and here too the foundations of each
chamber are carried down to water-level and filled
in with brick-rubble, as in the case of the wells
behind the Throne Room.</p>

<p>The same care that was taken to ensure the purity of
the water-supply may also be detected in the elaborate
drainage-system, with which the palace was provided,
with the object of carrying off the surface-water from the
flat palace-roofs, the open courts, and the fortification-walls.
The larger drains were roofed with corbelled
courses; the smaller ones, of a simpler but quite effective
construction, were formed of bricks set together in the
shape of a V and closed in at the top with other bricks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
laid flat. The tops of the fortifications, both in the
citadel itself and on the outer and inner city-wall, were
drained by means of vertical shafts, or gutters, running
down within the solid substructures of the towers;
and in the case of crude-brick buildings these have a
lining of burnt-brick. In some of the temples, which,
as we shall see, were invariably built of crude brick,<a name="FNanchor_84_100" id="FNanchor_84_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_100" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
this form of drainage was also adopted.</p>

<p>One other building within the palace deserves
mention, as it has been suggested that it may represent
the remains of the famous Hanging Gardens of
Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_85_101" id="FNanchor_85_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_101" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> It is reached from the north-east corner of
the Central Court<a name="FNanchor_86_102" id="FNanchor_86_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_102" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> along a broad passage-way,<a name="FNanchor_87_103" id="FNanchor_87_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_103" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> from
which a branch passage turns off at right angles; and
on the left side of this narrower passage are its two
entrances.<a name="FNanchor_88_104" id="FNanchor_88_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_104" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> It must be confessed that at first sight the
ground-plan of this building does not suggest a garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of any sort, least of all one that became famous as a
wonder of the ancient world. It will be seen that the
central part, or core, of the building is surrounded by a
strong wall and within are fourteen narrow cells or
chambers, seven on each side of a central gangway.<a name="FNanchor_89_105" id="FNanchor_89_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_105" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
The cells were roofed in with semicircular arches,
forming a barrel vault over each; and the whole is
encircled by a narrow corridor, flanked on the north
and east sides by the outer palace-wall. This part of
the building, both the vaulted chambers and the surrounding
corridor, lies completely below the level of
the rest of the palace. The small chambers, some of
them long and narrow like the vaults, which enclose the
central core upon the west and south, are on the palace
level; and the subterranean portion is reached by a
stairway in one of the rooms on the south side.<a name="FNanchor_90_106" id="FNanchor_90_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_106" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>There are two main reasons which suggested the
identification of this building with the Hanging Gardens.
The first is that hewn stone was used in its construction,
which is attested by the numerous broken fragments
discovered among its ruins. With the exception of the
Sacred Road and the bridge over the Euphrates, there
is only one other place on the whole site of Babylon
where hewn stone is used in bulk for building purposes,
and that is the northern wall of the Ḳaṣr. Now, in all
the literature referring to Babylon, stone is only recorded
to have been used for buildings in two places, and those
are the north wall of the Citadel and in the Hanging
Gardens, a lower layer in the latter's roofing, below the
layer of earth, being described as made of stone. These
facts certainly point to the identification of the Vaulted
Building with the Hanging Gardens.<a name="FNanchor_91_107" id="FNanchor_91_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_107" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Moreover,
Berossus definitely places them within the buildings by
which Nebuchadnezzar enlarged his father's palace; but
this reference would apply equally to the later Central
Citadel constructed by Nebuchadnezzar immediately to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the north of his main palace. The size of the building
is also far greater in Strabo and Diodorus than that of
the Vaulted Building, the side of the quadrangle,
according to these writers, measuring about four times
the latter's length. But discrepancy in figures of this
sort, as we have already seen in the case of the outer
walls of the city, is easily explicable and need not be
reckoned as a serious objection.<a name="FNanchor_92_108" id="FNanchor_92_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_108" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The second reason which pointed to the identification
is that, in one of the small chambers near the south-west
corner of the outer fringe of rooms on those two
sides, there is a very remarkable well. It consists of
three adjoining shafts, a square one in the centre
flanked by two of oblong shape. This arrangement,
unique so far as the remains of ancient Babylon are
concerned, may be most satisfactorily explained on the
assumption that we here have the water-supply for a
hydraulic machine, constructed on the principle of
a chain-pump. The buckets, attached to an endless
chain, would have passed up one of the outside wells,
over a great wheel fixed above them, and, after emptying
their water into a trough as they passed, would
have descended the other outside well for refilling. The
square well in the centre obviously served as an
inspection-chamber, down which an engineer could
descend to clean the well out, or to remove any obstruction.
In the modern contrivances of this sort,
sometimes employed to-day in Babylonia to raise a
continuous flow of water to the irrigation-trenches, the
motive-power for turning the winch is supplied by
horses or other animals moving round in a circle. In
the Vaulted Building there would have been scarcely
room for such an arrangement, and it is probable that
gangs of slaves were employed to work a couple of
heavy hand-winches. The discovery of the well undoubtedly
serves to strengthen the case for identification.</p>

<p class="caption">EASTERN TOWERS OF THE ISHTAR GATE</p>
</div>

<p>Two alternative schemes are put forward to reconstitute
the upper structure of this building. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
massive walls suggest in any case that they were intended
to support a considerable weight, and it may be
that the core of the building, constructed over the
subterranean vaults, towered high above its surrounding
chambers which are on the palace-level. This
would have been in accordance with the current
conception of a hanging garden; and, since on two
sides it was bounded by the palace-wall, its trees and
vegetation would have been visible from outside the
citadel. Seen thus from the lower level of the town,
the height of the garden would have been reinforced by
the whole height of the Citadel-mound on which the
palace stands, and imagination once kindled might have
played freely with its actual measurements.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the semicircular arches, still preserved
within the central core, may have directly
supported the thick layer of earth in which the trees
of the garden were planted. These would then have
been growing on the palace-level, as it were in a garden-court,
perhaps surrounded by a pillared colonnade with
the outer chambers opening on to it on the west and
south sides. In either scheme the subterranean vaults
can only have been used as stores or magazines, since
they were entirely without light. As a matter of fact,
a large number of tablets were found in the stairway-chamber
that leads down to them; and, since the
inscriptions upon them relate to grain, it would seem
that some at least were used as granaries. But this is
a use to which they could only have been put if the
space above them was not a garden, watered continuously
by an irrigation-pump, as moisture would have
been bound to reach the vaults.<a name="FNanchor_93_109" id="FNanchor_93_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_109" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Whichever alternative scheme we adopt, it must be
confessed that the Hanging Gardens have not justified
their reputation. And if they merely formed a garden-court,
as Dr. Koldewey inclines to believe, it is difficult
to explain the adjectives [κρεμαστός] and <i>pensilis.</i> For
the subterranean vaults would have been completely
out of sight, and, even when known to be below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
pavement-level, were not such as to excite wonder or
to suggest the idea of suspension in the air. One cannot
help suspecting that the vaulted building may
really, after all, be nothing more than the palace
granary,
and the triple well one of the main water-supplies
for domestic use. We may, at least for the
present, be permitted to hope that a more convincing
site for the gardens will be found in the Central Citadel
after further excavation.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 12. <br />BULL IN ENAMELLED BRICK FROM THE ISHTAR GATE.</p>
</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1901 the writer spent some time
in Babylon, stopping with Dr. Koldewey in the
substantial expedition-house they have built with fine
burnt-brick from Nebuchadnezzar's palace. At that
time he had uncovered a good deal of the palace, and it
was even then possible to trace out the walls of the
Throne Room and note the recess where the throne
itself had stood. But, beyond the fragments of the
enamelled façade, little of artistic interest had been
found, and on other portions of the site the results had
been still more disappointing. The deep excavation of
E-sagila had already been made, the temple of the goddess
Ninmakh had been completely excavated, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
work was in full swing on that of the god Ninib. All
proved to be of unburnt brick,<a name="FNanchor_94_110" id="FNanchor_94_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_110" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and the principal decoration
of the walls was a thin lime-wash. Their discoverer
was inclined to be sceptical of Babylon's fabled
splendour.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 13.<br />DRAGON IN ENAMELLED BRICK FROM THE ISHTAR GATE.</p>
</div>

<p>But in the following spring he made the discovery
which still remains the most striking achievement of
the expedition, and has rehabilitated the fame of that
ancient city. This was the great Ishtar Gate, which
spanned Babylon's Sacred Way, and the bulls and
dragons with which it was adorned have proved that
the glyptic art of Babylonia attained a high level of
perfection during its later period. The gate was
erected at the point where the Sacred Way entered
the older city. It was, in fact, the main gate in the
two walls of crude brick along the north side of the
Citadel, which we have seen reason to believe were
the famous defences, Imgur-Bêl and Nimitti-Bêl.<a name="FNanchor_95_111" id="FNanchor_95_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_111" class="fnanchor">[95]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Its structure, when rebuilt by Nebuchadnezzar, was
rather elaborate.<a name="FNanchor_96_112" id="FNanchor_96_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_112" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> It is a double gateway consisting
of two separate gate-houses,<a name="FNanchor_97_113" id="FNanchor_97_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_113" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> each with an outer and
an inner door.<a name="FNanchor_98_114" id="FNanchor_98_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_114" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The reason for this is that the line of
fortification is a double one, and each of its walls has
a gateway of its own. But the gates are united into
a single structure by means of short connecting walls,
which complete the enclosure of the Gateway Court.<a name="FNanchor_99_115" id="FNanchor_99_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_115" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Koldewey considers it probable that this court was
roofed in, to protect the great pair of doors, which
swung back into it, from the weather. But if so, the
whole roofing of the gateway must have been at the
same low level; whereas the thick walls of the inner
gate-house suggest that it and its arched doorways
rose higher than the outer gateway, as is suggested
in the section<a name="FNanchor_100_116" id="FNanchor_100_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_116" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and in the reconstruction of the Citadel.<a name="FNanchor_101_117" id="FNanchor_101_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_117" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>It thus appears more probable that the court between
the two gateways was left open, and that the two
inner arches<a name="FNanchor_102_118" id="FNanchor_102_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_118" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> rose far higher than those of the outer
gate.<a name="FNanchor_103_119" id="FNanchor_103_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_119" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> And there is the more reason for this, as an
open court would have given far more light for viewing
the remarkable decoration of the gateway upon its
inner walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be noticed in the plan that the central
roadway is not the only entrance through the gate;
on each side of the two central gate-houses a wing is
thrown out, making four wings in all. These also are
constructed of burnt-brick, and they serve to connect
the gate with the two fortification-walls of unburnt
brick. In each wing is a further door, giving access
to the space between the walls. Thus, in all, the gate
has three separate entrances, and no less than eight
doorways, four ranged along the central roadway, and
two in each double wing.</p>

positions of Bulls or Dragons still in place upon its walls. The head of each
arrow points in the same direction as the beast to which it refers. Where no
beasts are preserved, the foundations of the structure are indicated by a dotted
line. The index letters correspond to those in Fig. 14.</p>

<p class="caption">(After Koldewey.)</p>
</div>

<p>The whole wall-surface of the gateway on its
northern side, both central towers and side-wings, was
decorated with alternate rows of bulls and dragons in
brick relief, the rows ranged one above the other up
the surface of walls and towers. The decoration is
continued over the whole interior surface of the central
gateways and may be traced along the southern front
of the inner gate-house. The beasts are arranged in
such a way that to any one entering the city they
would appear as though advancing to meet him. In
the accompanying diagram,<a name="FNanchor_104_120" id="FNanchor_104_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_120" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> which gives the ground-plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of the gate in outline, the arrows indicate the positions
of beasts that are still in place upon the walls, and
the head of each arrow points in the direction that
animal faces. It will be noticed that along most of
the walls running north and south the beasts face
northwards, while on the transverse walls they face
inwards towards the centre. One end-wall in chamber
B is preserved, and there, for the sake of symmetry,
the two animals face each other, advancing from opposite
directions. It has been calculated that at least
five hundred and seventy-five of these creatures were
represented on the walls and towers of the gateway.
Some of the walls, with their successive tiers of beasts,
are still standing to a height of twelve metres. The
two eastern towers of the outer gate-house are the
best preserved, and even in their present condition
they convey some idea of the former magnificence
of the building.</p>

<p>In the greater part of the structure that still remains
in place, it is apparent that the brickwork was very
roughly finished, and that the bitumen employed as
mortar has been left where it has oozed out between the
courses. The explanation is that the portions of the
gateway which still stand are really foundations of
the building, and were always intended to be buried
below the pavement level. It is clear that the height
of the road-way was constantly raised while the building
of the gate was in progress, and there are traces of two
temporary pavements,<a name="FNanchor_105_121" id="FNanchor_105_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_121" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> afterwards filled in when the final
pavement-level<a name="FNanchor_106_122" id="FNanchor_106_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_122" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> was reached.<a name="FNanchor_107_123" id="FNanchor_107_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_123" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The visible portion of
the gate above the last pavement has been entirely destroyed,
but among its <i>débris</i> were found thousands of
fragments of the same two animals, but in enamelled
brick of brilliant colouring, white and yellow against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
blue ground. Some of these have been laboriously
pieced together in Berlin, and specimens are now
exhibited in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum and in the
Imperial Ottoman Museum at Constantinople. Only
one fragment of an enamelled portion of the wall was
found in place,<a name="FNanchor_108_124" id="FNanchor_108_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_124" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and that was below the final pavement.

<p>The delicate modelling of the figures is to some
extent obscured in the foundation specimens, but the
imperfections there visible are entirely absent from the
enamelled series. An examination of the latter shows
that the bricks were separately moulded, and, before
the process of enamelling, were burnt in the usual way.
The contours of the figures were then outlined in black
with a vitreous paste, the surfaces so defined being
afterwards filled in with coloured liquid enamels. The
paste of the black outlines and the coloured enamels
themselves had evidently the same fusing point, for
when fired they have sometimes shaded off into one
another, giving a softness and a pleasing variety of tone
to the composition.<a name="FNanchor_110_126" id="FNanchor_110_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_126" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> It should be added that the

relief, the same moulds having been employed for both.</p>

<p class="p2">Before the Neo-Babylonian period the Ishtar Gate
had defended the northern entrance to the city, and was
probably a massive structure of unburnt brick without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
external decoration. But, with the building of the outer
city-wall, it stood in the second line of defence. And as
Nebuchadnezzar extended the fortifications of the Citadel
itself upon the northern side, it lost still more of its
strategic importance, and from its interior position
became a fit subject for the decorator's art. The whole
course of the roadway through these exterior defences
he flanked with mighty walls, seven metres thick,
extending from the gate northwards to the outermost
wall and moat.<a name="FNanchor_111_127" id="FNanchor_111_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_127" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Their great strength was dictated by
the fact that, should an enemy penetrate the outer city-wall,
he would have to pass between them, under the
garrison's fire, to reach the citadel-gate. But these, like
the gate itself, formed a secondary or interior defence,
and so, like it, were elaborately decorated. The side of
each wall facing the roadway was adorned with a long
frieze of lions, in low relief and brilliantly enamelled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
which were represented advancing southwards towards
the Ishtar Gate. The surface of each wall was broken
up into panels by a series of slightly projecting towers,
each panel probably containing two lions, while the
plinth below the Lion Frieze was decorated with rosettes.
There appear to have been sixty lions along each wall.
Some were in white enamel with yellow manes, while
others were in yellow and had red manes,<a name="FNanchor_112_128" id="FNanchor_112_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_128" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and they
stood out against a light or dark blue ground. Leading
as they did to the bulls and dragons of the gateway, we
can realize in some degree the effect produced upon a
stranger entering the inner city of Babylon for the first
time.</p>

<p class="caption">LION FROM THE FRIEZE OF THE SACRED WAY TO THE NORTH OF THE

<p>Such a stranger, passing within the Ishtar Gate,
would have been struck with wonder at the broad
Procession Street,<a name="FNanchor_113_129" id="FNanchor_113_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_129" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> which ran its long course straight
through the city from north to south, with the great
temples ranged on either hand. Its foundation of burnt
brick covered with bitumen is still preserved, upon
which, to the south of the gateway, rested a pavement
of massive flags, the centre of fine hard limestone, the
sides of red breccia veined with white. In inscriptions
upon the edges of these paving slabs, formerly hidden
by their asphalt mortar, Nebuchadnezzar boasts that he
paved the street of Babylon for the procession of the
great lord Marduk, to whom he prays for eternal life.<a name="FNanchor_114_130" id="FNanchor_114_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_130" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
The slabs that are still in place are polished with hard
use, but, unlike the pavements of Pompeii, show no
ruts or indentations such as we might have expected
from the chariots of the later period. It is possible
that, in view of its sacred character, the use of the road
was restricted to foot passengers and beasts of burden,
except when the king and his retinue passed along it
through the city. And in any case, not counting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
chariots of war and state, there was probably very little
wheeled traffic in Babylonia at any time.</p>

<p>When clear of the citadel the road descends by
a gradual slope to the level of the plain, and preserving
the same breadth, passes to the right of the temple
dedicated to Ishtar of Akkad.<a name="FNanchor_115_131" id="FNanchor_115_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_131" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> As it continues southward
it is flanked at a little distance on the east by the
streets of private houses, whose foundations have been
uncovered in the Merkes mound;<a name="FNanchor_116_132" id="FNanchor_116_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_132" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and on the west side
it runs close under the huge peribolos of E-temen-anki,
the Tower of Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_117_133" id="FNanchor_117_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_133" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> As far as the main gate of
E-temen-anki<a name="FNanchor_118_134" id="FNanchor_118_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_134" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> its foundation is laid in burnt-brick,
over which was an upper paving completely formed of
breccia. The inscription upon the slabs corresponds to
that on the breccia paving-stones opposite the citadel;
but they have evidently been re-used from an earlier
pavement of Sennacherib, whose name some of them
bear upon the underside. This earlier pavement of
Babylon's Sacred Way must have been laid by that
monarch before he reversed his conciliatory policy toward
the southern kingdom. At the south-east corner of

between the peribolos and E-sagila, the great
temple of the city-god, passes through a gate in the
river-wall built by Nabonidus, and so over the Euphrates
bridge before turning southward again in the direction
of Borsippa.<a name="FNanchor_119_135" id="FNanchor_119_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_135" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> This branch road between the Tower of

of the procession-street. For not only was it the way
of approach to Marduk's temple, but its course has been
definitely traced by excavation. But there can be no
doubt that the upper portion of the road, running north
and south through the city, was continued in a straight
line from the point where the Sacred Way branched
off. This would have conducted an important stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of traffic to the main gate in the southern city-wall,
passing on its way between the temples dedicated to
the god Ninib and to another deity not yet identified.<a name="FNanchor_121_137" id="FNanchor_121_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_137" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p class="caption">THE SACRED WAY OF BABYLON</p>
</div>

<p>Apart from the royal palaces, the five temples of
Babylon were the principal buildings within the city,
and their excavation has thrown an entirely new light
upon our ideas of the religious architecture of the
country. The ground-plans of four of them have now
been ascertained in their entirety, and we are consequently
in a position to form some idea of the general
principles upon which such buildings were arranged.
The first to be excavated was the little temple E-makh,
dedicated to the goddess Ninmakh, which, as we have
already seen, was built on the citadel itself, in the
north-east corner of the open space to the south of the
Ishtar Gateway. Its principal façade faces the north-west,
and, since the eastern entrance of the Ishtar Gate
opens just opposite the corner of the temple, a wall
with a doorway in it was thrown across, spanning the
passage between temple and fortification.<a name="FNanchor_122_138" id="FNanchor_122_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_138" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The only
entrance to the temple was in the centre of the façade;
and in the passage-way immediately in front of it, surrounded
by a pavement of burnt-brick, is a small crude-brick
altar.<a name="FNanchor_123_139" id="FNanchor_123_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_139" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It is an interesting fact that the only other
altar yet found in Babylon is also of crude brick and
occupies precisely the same position, outside a temple
and immediately opposite its main entrance;<a name="FNanchor_124_140" id="FNanchor_124_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_140" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> while in
a third temple, though the altar itself has disappeared,
the paved area which surrounded it is still visible.<a name="FNanchor_125_141" id="FNanchor_125_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_141" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> We
may therefore conclude that this represents the normal
position for the altar in the Babylonian cult; and it fully
substantiates the statement of Herodotus that the two
altars of Belus were outside his temple.<a name="FNanchor_126_142" id="FNanchor_126_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_142" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> One of these,
he tells us, was of solid gold, on which it was only
lawful to offer sucklings; the other was a common altar
(doubtless of crude brick) but of great size, on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
full-grown animals were sacrificed. It was also on the
great altar that the Chaldeans burnt the frankincense,
which, according to Herodotus, was offered to the
amount of a thousand talents' weight every year at
the festival of the god.</p>

<p>It may further be noted that this exterior position
of the altar corresponds to Hebrew usage, according to
which the main altar was erected in the outer court in
front of the temple proper. Thus Solomon's brazen
altar, which under Phoenician influence took the place
of earlier altars of earth or unhewn stone,<a name="FNanchor_127_143" id="FNanchor_127_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_143" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> stood before
the temple.<a name="FNanchor_128_144" id="FNanchor_128_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_144" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The altar within the Hebrew temple was
of cedar-wood,<a name="FNanchor_129_145" id="FNanchor_129_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_145" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and it was clearly not a permanent
structure embedded in the pavement, for Ezekiel refers
to it as a "table," and states that it "was of wood."<a name="FNanchor_130_146" id="FNanchor_130_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_146" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
It was more in the nature of a table for offerings, and
it may be inferred that in earlier times it served as the
table upon which the shewbread was placed before
Yahwe.<a name="FNanchor_131_147" id="FNanchor_131_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_147" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The complete absence of any trace of a permanent
altar within the Babylonian temples can only
be due to a similar practice; the altars or tables within
the shrines must have been light wooden structures, and
they were probably carried off or burnt when the temples
were destroyed. There is of course no need to regard
this resemblance as due to direct cultural influence or
borrowing. But we may undoubtedly conclude that
we here have an example of parallelism in religious
ritual between two races of the same Semitic stock.
What the Sumerian practice was in this respect we
have as yet no means of ascertaining; but in such
details of cult it is quite possible that the Semitic
Babylonians substituted their own traditional usages for
any other they may have found in the country of their
adoption.</p>

<p>The temple of Ninmakh itself, like all the others in
Babylon, was built of crude brick, and though its walls
were covered with a thin plaster or wash of lime, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the simplest form of decoration in black and white was
attempted, and that very sparingly.<a name="FNanchor_132_148" id="FNanchor_132_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_148" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
The fact that the
practice of building in mud-brick should have continued
at a time when kiln-burnt and enamelled brick was
lavished on the royal palaces, is probably to be explained
as a result of religious conservatism. The
architectural design does not differ in essentials from
that employed for buildings of a military character. It
will be seen that the long exterior walls of E-makh
resemble those of a fortification, their surface being
broken up by slightly projecting towers set at regular
intervals.<a name="FNanchor_133_149" id="FNanchor_133_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_149" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Larger rectangular towers flank the gateway,
and two others, diminishing in size and probably
also in height, are ranged on either side of them. The
vertical grooves, which traverse the exterior faces of the
towers from top to bottom, constitute a characteristic
form of temple embellishment, which is never found on
buildings of a secular character. They may be either
plain rectangular grooves, or more usually, as in E-makh,
are stepped when viewed in section.<a name="FNanchor_134_150" id="FNanchor_134_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_150" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>In all the important doorways of the temples foundation-deposits
were buried in little niches or boxes, formed
of six bricks placed together and hidden below the level
of the pavement. The deposits found in place are
generally fashioned of baked clay, and that of most
common occurrence is a small figure of the god Papsukal.
One of those in Ninmakh's temple was in the
form of a bird, no doubt sacred to the goddess. There
is clear evidence that the object of their burial was to
ensure the safety of the entrance both from spiritual
and from human foes. In addition to this magical protection
the entrance was further secured by double doors,
their pivots shod with bronze and turning in massive
stone sockets. The ordinary method of fastening such
doors by bolts was supplemented in the case of E-makh
by a beam propped against the doors and with its lower
end fitting into a socket in the pavement. Since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
temple was within the citadel fortifications, the possibility
was foreseen that it might have to be defended
from assault like the secular buildings in its immediate
neighbourhood.</p>

the court, and, like the main gateway of the temple,
the façade of the shrine and the flanking towers of its
doorway were adorned with stepped grooves. The
shrine itself is approached through an ante-chamber,
and each has a small service-apartment opening out
from it to the left. Against the back wall of the
shrine, immediately opposite the doors, stood the cult
image of the goddess, visible from the open court; this
has disappeared, but the foundations of the low dais or
postament, on which it stood, are still in place.</p>

<p>The long narrow passage behind the shrine<a name="FNanchor_136_152" id="FNanchor_136_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_152" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> was
thought at first by its discoverer to have served a secret
purpose of the priesthood. It was suggested that it
might have given access to a concealed opening in the
back wall of the shrine, behind the image of the goddess,
whence oracles could have been given forth with her
authority. But there is a precisely similar passage
along the north-east wall; and we may probably accept
the more prosaic explanation that they contained the
ramps or stairways that led up to the flat roof, though
why two should have been required, both at the same
end of the building, is not clear.<a name="FNanchor_137_153" id="FNanchor_137_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_153" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The precise use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the other chambers opening from the court cannot be
identified with any certainty, as nothing was found in
them to indicate whether they served as apartments
for the priesthood or as magazines for temple-stores.
Beyond a number of votive terracotta figures, no cult
object was discovered. But around the dais for the
image of the goddess, the well in the courtyard for
lustral water, and the small crude-brick altar before the
temple entrance, it is possible to picture in imagination
some of the rites to which reference is made in the
Babylonian religious texts.</p>

<p>As we have already seen was the case with the
palace-buildings, the upper structure of all the temples
has been completely destroyed, so that it is not now
certain how the tops of walls and towers were finished
off. In the conjectural restoration of Ninmakh's
temple<a name="FNanchor_138_154" id="FNanchor_138_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_154" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> the upper portions are left perfectly plain.
And this represents one theory of reconstruction. But
it is also possible that the walls were crowned with the
stepped battlements of military architecture. In the
restoration of Assyrian buildings, both secular and
religious, great assistance has been obtained from the
sculptured bas-reliefs that lined the palace walls. For
the scenes upon them include many representations of
buildings, and, when due allowance has been made for
the conventions employed, a considerable degree of
certainty may be attained with their help in picturing
the external appearance of buildings of which only the
lower courses of the walls now remain. The scarcity
of stone in Babylonia, and the consequent absence of
mural reliefs, have deprived us of this source of information
in the case of the southern kingdom. The only
direct evidence on the point that has been forthcoming
consists of a design stamped in outline upon a
rectangular gold plaque, found with other fragments of
gold and jewellery in the remains of a sumptuous burial
within the structure of Nabopolassar's palace.<a name="FNanchor_139_155" id="FNanchor_139_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_155" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The
period of the burial is certain, for the grave in which
the great pottery sarcophagus was placed had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
closed with bricks of Nebuchadnezzar, who afterwards
built his strengthening wall against it. It must therefore
date from the earlier part of his reign, and Dr.
Koldewey makes the suggestion that it was perhaps the
tomb of Nabopolassar himself.<a name="FNanchor_140_156" id="FNanchor_140_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_156" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> However that may be,
the grave is certainly of the early Neo-Babylonian
period, and the architectural design upon the gold
plaque may be taken as good evidence for that time.</p>

<p class="caption2">The engraving on the plaque
shows a city-gate with flanking
towers and stepped battlements.
(Enlargement after photo, by
Koldewey.)</p>
</div>

<p>The plaque formed the principal decoration in a
chain bracelet, small rings passing through the holes at
its four corners and serving to attach it to the larger
links of the chain. On it
the jeweller has represented
a gate with an arched doorway,
flanked by towers,
which rise above the walls of
the main building. Each
tower is surmounted by a
projecting upper structure,
pierced with small circular
loopholes, and both towers
and walls are crowned with
triangular battlements. The
latter are obviously intended
to be stepped, the engraver
not having sufficient space
to represent this detail in a
design on so small a scale.
The outline is probably that
of a fortified city-gate, and it
fully justifies the adoption of the stepped battlement in
the reconstruction of military buildings of the period.
Whether the temples were furnished in the same manner,
for purely decorative purposes, is not so clear. Some
idea of the appearance of one, restored on this alternative
hypothesis, may be gathered from the elevation of the
unidentified temple known as "Z," which is given in
Fig. 24.</p>

<p>It is important that the ground-plans of no less than
four of the temples in Babylon have been recovered, for
it will be seen that the main features, already noted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Ninmakh's temple, are always repeated.<a name="FNanchor_141_157" id="FNanchor_141_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_157" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> In each the
temple buildings are arranged around an open court, to
which access is given through one or more entrances
with vestibules. The doorways to temple and to shrine
are flanked by grooved towers, while within the shrine
itself the cult-statue stood on a low dais, visible from
the court.</p>

<p>Yet with this general similarity, all combine
special features of their own. The temple "Z," for
example, is exactly rectangular in plan, and is divided
into two distinct parts, the object of which may be
readily surmised. The larger and eastern portion,
opening on the great court, was obviously devoted to
the service of the deity. For there, on the south side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
is the shrine and its ante-chamber, with the dais for the
eult-image against the south wall. The western portion
is grouped around two smaller courts, and, as its arrangement
resembles that of a private dwelling-house, we may
regard it as the quarters of the resident priesthood.
Other notable features are the three service-chambers
to the shrine, and the three separate entrances to the
temple itself, each with its own vestibule and porters'
room. But there is only one narrow passage, extending
partly behind the shrine and containing, as suggested,
a ramp or stairway to the roof. There was probably
an altar before the northern gate, as shown in the
restoration, but only the paved area on which it stood
was found to be still in place.</p>

<p>In the temples dedicated to Ishtar of Akkad and to
the god Ninib the shrines are on the west side of the
great court, instead of on the south as in those we
have already examined. Thus it would seem there
was no special position for the shrine, though the
temples themselves are generally built with their
corners directed approximately to the cardinal points.<a name="FNanchor_142_158" id="FNanchor_142_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_158" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
In the temple of Ishtar unmistakable traces have been
noted of a simple form of mural decoration that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
appears to have been employed in all the temples of
Babylon. While the walls in general were coloured
dead white with a thin gypsum wash, certain of the
more prominent parts, such as the main entrance, the
doorway leading to the shrine and the niche behind
the statue of the goddess, were washed over with
black asphalt in solution, each blackened surface being
decorated near its edge with white strips or line-borders.
The contrast in colour presented by this black and white
decoration must have been startling in its effect; no
doubt, like the crude-brick material of the buildings, it
was an inheritance from earlier times, and owed its
retention to its traditional religious significance.</p>

<p>In the temple of Ninib two additional shrines flank
the principal one, each having its own entrance and a
dais or postament for a statue. It is probable that the
side shrines were devoted to the worship of subsidiary
deities connected in some way with Ninib, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
temple as a whole was dedicated solely to him. This
we learn from Nabopolassar's foundation-cylinders,
buried below the pavement of the shrine, which relate
how the king erected the building in his honour, on an
earlier foundation, after he had kept back the foot of
the Assyrian from the land of Akkad and had thrown
off his heavy yoke.<a name="FNanchor_143_159" id="FNanchor_143_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_159" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> It was fitting that he should have

<p>The most interesting temple of Babylon is naturally
that dedicated to the worship of the city-god. This
was the famous E-sagila, a great part of which still lies
buried some twenty-one metres below the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Tell 'Amrân.<a name="FNanchor_144_160" id="FNanchor_144_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_160" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Its main portion, lying to the west, is
practically square in ground-plan, and like the smaller
temples of the city, it consists of chambers grouped
around an open court; but their arrangement here is
far more symmetrical.<a name="FNanchor_145_161" id="FNanchor_145_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_161" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> There was a great gateway in
the centre of each side, where in Neriglissar's time stood
the eight bronze serpents, a pair of them beside each
entrance.<a name="FNanchor_146_162" id="FNanchor_146_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_162" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The eastern gate was no doubt the principal
one, as it gives access to the inner court through a
single great vestibule or entrance-chamber, in striking
contrast to the smaller vestibules on the north and
south sides, from which the court can be reached only
through side-corridors.<a name="FNanchor_147_163" id="FNanchor_147_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_163" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Around the great court within,
the temple doorways and towers are arranged symmetrically.
The shrine of Marduk lay on its western
side, as may be inferred from the façade and towered
entrance. This was the E-kua of the inscriptions, which
Nebuchadnezzar states he made to shine like the sun,
coating its walls with gold as though with gypsum-plaster,
a phrase which recalls the mud and gypsum
washes of the other temples. "The best of my cedars,"
he says, "that I brought from Lebanon, the noble
forest, I sought out for the roofing of Ekua, [Marduk's]
lordly chamber; the mighty cedars I covered with
gleaming gold for the roofing of Ekua."<a name="FNanchor_148_164" id="FNanchor_148_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_164" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The lavish
employment of gold in the temple's decoration is
attested by Herodotus, who states that in this, "the
lower temple,"<a name="FNanchor_149_165" id="FNanchor_149_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_165" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> was a great seated figure of Zeus,
which, like the throne, the dais, and the table before it,
was fashioned of gold, the metal weighing altogether
eight hundred talents.<a name="FNanchor_150_166" id="FNanchor_150_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_166" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>The identification of the temple was rendered certain
by the discovery of inscribed bricks in earlier pavements
below those of Nebuchadnezzar. Inscriptions stamped
upon bricks from two pavements of Ashur-bani-pal
record that this Assyrian king made "bricks of E-sagila
and E-temen-anki," while on an older one which he
re-used, stamped with the name of Esarhaddon, it is
definitely stated that it formed part of the paving of
E-sagila.<a name="FNanchor_151_167" id="FNanchor_151_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_167" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> These pavements were reached by means of
an open excavation in Tell 'Amrân, extending some
forty metres each way. It took no less than eight
months to remove the soil to the pavement level, and it
is estimated that some thirty thousand cubic metres of
earth were carted away in the course of the work. It
is not surprising, therefore, that the chambers on the
west side of the court, including the shrine of Marduk,
still remain covered by the mound. A subsidiary
shrine, on the north side of the court, has been cleared,
and it would be a spot of considerable interest
if, as Dr. Koldewey suggests, it was dedicated to Ea.
For in the Hellenistic period Ea was identified with
Serapis, and should this prove to have been his
sanctuary, it was here that Alexander's generals
repaired during his illness, when they enquired of the
god whether he should be carried thither to be
healed.<a name="FNanchor_152_168" id="FNanchor_152_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_168" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>To the north of Marduk's temple rose its ziggurat,
the Tower of Babel, known to Babylonians of all ages
as E-temen-anki, "The House of the Foundation-stone
of Heaven and Earth." It stood within its Peribolos
or sacred precincts, marked now by the flat area or
plain which the local Arabs call Sakhn, "the pan."<a name="FNanchor_153_169" id="FNanchor_153_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_169" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
The precincts of the tower were surrounded by an
enclosing wall, decorated with innumerable grooved
towers, along the east and south sides of which the
track of the Sacred Way may still be followed.<a name="FNanchor_154_170" id="FNanchor_154_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_170" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> On the

ascertained that three separate stairways ascended the

flanked on their outer sides by stepped walls, which
formed a solid breastwork or protection for any one

<p class="caption">CONJECTURAL RECONSTRUCTION OF E-TEMEN-ANKI AND E-SAGILA.</p>

<p class="caption2">The form of the Temple-tower within the Peribolos is here restored in accordance
with Dr. Koldewey's theory that it consisted of a single stage or story, on
which the upper Temple of Marduk rested. According to an alternative interpretation
of Herodotus, the upper Temple would have formed the last of eight
receding towers or stages. It will be noted that the two flanking stairways,
recently discovered on the south side of the tower, are here not shown.</p>

<p class="caption">(After Andrae.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The buildings within the precincts were evidently
not temples, as they present none of their characteristic
features, such as the shrine or the towered façade, and
any theory as to their use must be based on pure conjecture.
Judging solely by their ground-plans, it would
appear that the two great buildings on the east side,<a name="FNanchor_160_176" id="FNanchor_160_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_176" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
consisting of a long series of narrow chambers ranged
around open courts, were probably the magazines and
store-chambers. The buildings on the south side resemble
dwelling-houses, and were probably the quarters
of the priesthood; their huge size would not have been
out of keeping with the privileges and dignified position
enjoyed by those in control of the principal temple in
the capital. The small chambers along the walls of the
Northern Court,<a name="FNanchor_161_177" id="FNanchor_161_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_177" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and the narrow Western Court,<a name="FNanchor_162_178" id="FNanchor_162_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_178" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> may
well have been used to house the thousands of pilgrims
who doubtless flocked to Babylon to worship at the
central shrine. No less than twelve gateways led into
the sacred precincts, the principal entrance being on the
east side,<a name="FNanchor_163_179" id="FNanchor_163_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_179" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> exactly opposite the east face of the temple-tower.
The breccia paving of the Sacred Way was here
continued within the area of the precincts, along the
centre of the open space, or deep recess, between the
temple-magazines. The great gateway probably spanned
the western end of this recess, thus completing the line
of the Main Court upon that side.<a name="FNanchor_164_180" id="FNanchor_164_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_180" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The most striking feature of E-temen-anki was
naturally the temple-tower itself, which rose high above
the surrounding buildings and must have been visible
from all parts of the city and from some considerable
distance beyond the walls. Its exact form has been
the subject of some controversy. Dr. Koldewey rejects
the current view, based upon the description of
Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_165_181" id="FNanchor_165_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_181" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> that it consisted of a stepped tower in
eight stages, with the ascent to the top encircling the
outside. It is true that the excavations have shown
that the ascent to the first stage, at any rate, was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of this character, consisting, as it did, of a triple stairway
built against one side of the tower;<a name="FNanchor_166_182" id="FNanchor_166_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_182" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> but, as the
ground-plan only of the building can now be traced,
there is nothing to indicate the form of its upper
structure. Dr. Koldewey does not regard the evidence
for the existence of stepped towers in Babylonia as satisfactory,
and he appears to consider that they depend
solely on the description of Herodotus, who, he claims,
says nothing about stepped terraces, nor that each stage
was smaller than the one below it. He is inclined to
reconstruct the tower as built in a single stage, decorated
on its face with coloured bands, and surmounted by the
temple to which the triple-stairway would have given
direct access. This view of its reconstruction is shown
in Fig. 28, but its author considers the problem as still
unsettled, and suspends his judgment until the Ziggurat
at Borsippa, the best preserved of the temple-towers, is
excavated.</p>

<p>There, as at Babylon, we have a temple and a
separate temple-tower, but they both stood within the
same peribolos or sacred enclosure, along the inner side
of which were built series of numerous small chambers
resembling those of E-temen-anki. A street<a name="FNanchor_167_183" id="FNanchor_167_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_183" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> ran along
the north-west front of the peribolos, and two gateways<a name="FNanchor_168_184" id="FNanchor_168_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_184" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
opened on to it from the sacred enclosure. The main
entrance both to peribolos and temple was probably on
the north-east side.<a name="FNanchor_169_185" id="FNanchor_169_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_185" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> It will be noted that the plan of
the temple<a name="FNanchor_170_186" id="FNanchor_170_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_186" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> follows the lines of those already described,
consisting of a complex of buildings ranged around one
great court and a number of smaller ones. The shrine
of the god Nabû stood on the south-west side of the
Great Court, the heavily-towered façade indicating
the entrance to its outer vestibule. While so much of
the temple itself and of its enclosure has been cleared, the
temple-tower<a name="FNanchor_171_187" id="FNanchor_171_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_187" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> awaits excavation. It still rises to a
height of no less than forty-seven metres above the
surrounding plain, but such a mass of <i>débris</i> has fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
about its base that to clear it completely would entail
a vast amount of labour. The mound of soil not only
covers the open court surrounding the temple-tower,
but extends over the inner line of chambers on the
north-west side of the peribolos. The destruction of
the temple and its surroundings by fire has vitrified the
upper structure of the ziggurat, and to this fact the
ruins owe their preservation. For the bricks are welded
into a solid mass, and, since it is no longer possible to
separate them, they offer no attractions as building-material
and so have escaped the fate of E-temen-anki.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that, when Nabû's temple-tower
is excavated, it will throw some light upon the upper
structure of these massive buildings. Meanwhile we
possess a piece of evidence which should not be ignored in
any discussion of the subject. On a boundary-stone of
the time of Merodach-baladan I. are carved a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of emblems of the gods, including those of Marduk and
Nabii, which are set beside each other in the second
row. That of Marduk consists of his sacred Spear-head
supported by his dragon, that of Nabfi being the Wedge
or Stilus, also supported by a horned dragon. But
while the other emblems are left sculptured in relief
against the field of the stone, that of Nabii is engraved
against a temple-tower.<a name="FNanchor_172_188" id="FNanchor_172_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_188" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> It will be noticed that this
rises in stages, diminishing in size and set one above the
other. The rough engraving may well represent the
outward form of Nabû's temple-tower at Borsippa at
the time of Merodach-baladan I. In any case, since the
emblems on the boundary-stones are associated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
temples, the only building it can be intended for is
a temple-tower. It thus definitely proves the construction
of this class of building in stories or stages, which
diminish in area as they ascend.</p>

<p>Additional evidence that this was actually the form
of the Tower of Babylon has been deduced from a tablet,
drawn up in the Seleucid era, and purporting to give
a detailed description and measurements of E-sagila and
its temple-tower. A hurried description of the text
and its contents was published by George Smith<a name="FNanchor_173_189" id="FNanchor_173_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_189" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> before
he started on his last journey to the east, and from that
time the tablet was lost sight of. But some three years
ago it was found in Paris, and it has now been made
fully available for study.<a name="FNanchor_174_190" id="FNanchor_174_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_190" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> It must be admitted that
it is almost impossible at present to reconcile the
descriptions on the tablet with the actual remains of
E-sagila and the Peribolos that have been recovered by
excavation. The "Great Terrace (or Court)," and the
"Terrace (or Court) of Ishtar and Zamama," which,
according to the tablet, were the largest and most
important subdivisions in the sacred area, have not been
satisfactorily identified. Dr. Koldewey was inclined to
regard the former as corresponding to the Great Court<a name="FNanchor_175_191" id="FNanchor_175_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_191" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
of the Peribolos, including the buildings surrounding
it, and the latter he would identify with the northern
court of the enclosure;<a name="FNanchor_176_192" id="FNanchor_176_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_192" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> while the third great sub-division
he suggested might be the inner space of the
Great Court, which he thus had to count twice over.
Scarcely more satisfactory is M. Marcel Dieulafoy's
reconstruction, since he makes the two main areas, or
"terraces," extend to the east of the Sacred Way, over
ground which, as the excavations have shown, was
covered by the houses of the town, and thus lay beyond
the limits of the sacred area. It is possible that the
apparent discrepancies may be traced to an extensive
reconstruction of the Peribolos between the Neo-Babylonian
and the Seleucid periods. But, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
explanation be adopted, a number of detailed measurements
given by the tablet are best explained on the
hypothesis that they refer to receding stages of a
temple-tower. The tablet may thus be cited as affording
additional support to the current conception of the
Tower of Babylon, and there is no reason to reject
the interpretation that has so long been accepted of
the famous description of the tower that is given by
Herodotus.<a name="FNanchor_177_193" id="FNanchor_177_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_193" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>There is one other structure in Babylon that deserves
mention, and that is the bridge over the Euphrates, since
its remains are those of the earliest permanent bridge
of which we have any record in antiquity. It will be
noted from the ground-plan of E-temen-anki<a name="FNanchor_178_194" id="FNanchor_178_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_194" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> that the
procession-street leads past the corner of the Peribolos
to a great gate-way in the river-wall, guarding the head
of the bridge which crossed the Euphrates on stone
piers. The river at this point appears to have been one
hundred and twenty-three metres in breadth. The
piers are built in the shape of boats with their bows
pointing up-stream, and their form was no doubt
suggested by the earlier bridge-of-boats which they
displaced. The roadway, as in boat-bridges in Mesopotamia
at the present day, was laid across the boatpiers,
and must have been very much narrower than
the length of the piers themselves. The bridge, which
is mentioned by Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_179_195" id="FNanchor_179_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_195" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and Diodorus,<a name="FNanchor_180_196" id="FNanchor_180_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_196" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> was the
work of Nabopolassar, as we learn from the East India
House Inscription, in which Nebuchadnezzar states that
his father "had built piers of burnt brick for the
crossing of the Euphrates."<a name="FNanchor_181_197" id="FNanchor_181_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_197" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The stone used in its
construction, which is referred to by Herodotus, was
no doubt laid above the brick-piers, as a foundation
for the flat wooden structure of the bridge itself. The
later river-wall was the work of Nabonidus and it
marks an extension of the bank westwards, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
rendered possible by the building of Nebuchadnezzar's
fortification in the bed of the river to the west of the
Southern Citadel.<a name="FNanchor_182_198" id="FNanchor_182_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_198" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The old line of the left bank is
marked by the ruins of earlier river-walls, traces of
which have been uncovered below the north-west angle
of the Peribolos.<a name="FNanchor_183_199" id="FNanchor_183_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_199" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> It was doubtless to protect the
Peribolos and E-sagila from flood that the bank was
extended in this way.</p>

<p>The buildings that have hitherto been described
all date from the later Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian
periods, and during their first years of work at Babylon
the excavators found nothing that could be assigned
to the earlier epochs in the history of the capital. It
was assumed that the destruction of Babylon by Sennacherib
had been so thorough that very little of the
earlier city had survived. But later on it was realized
that the remains of the older Babylon lay largely below
the present water-level. The continual deposit of silt
in the bed of the river has raised the level at which
water is reached when digging on the site of the city,
and it is clear that at the time of the First Dynasty
the general level of the town was considerably lower
than in later periods. During recent years a comparatively
small body of water has flowed along the
Euphrates bed, so that it has been possible on the
Merkes Mound to uncover one quarter in the ancient
city. There trenches have been cut to a depth of
twelve metres, when water-level was reached and further
progress was rendered impossible, although the remains
of buildings continued still lower.</p>

</div>

<p>From the accompanying plan it will be seen that
the street net-work has been recovered over a considerable
area. The entire structure of the mound consists
of the dwellings of private citizens, rising layer above
layer from below water-level to the surface of the soil.
The upper strata date from the Parthian period, and
here the houses are scattered with wide spaces of
garden or waste land between them. In striking contrast
to these scanty remains are the streets of the
Greek, Persian and Neo-Babylonian periods, where the
houses are crowded together, and open spaces, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
were at one time courts or gardens, have later on been
surrendered to the builder. We here have striking
proof of the value of house-property in Babylon during
the city's period of greatest prosperity. Still deeper
in the mound a level can be dated to the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, for in the houses were found
tablets inscribed in the reigns of Merodach-baladan I.,
Meli-Shipak II., and Enlil-nadin-shum. In the northern
part of the mound, in the lowest stratum of all and
lying partly above and partly below water-level, contract-tablets
of the First Dynasty were uncovered,
bearing date-formulæ of Samsu-iluna, Ammi-ditana and
Samsu-ditana. Here the mud-brick walls of the houses,
though not very thick, all rest upon burnt-brick foundations,
a method of building which, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_184_200" id="FNanchor_184_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_200" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
survived into the Neo-Babylonian period. This is the
earliest city of which traces have been recovered, and
a thick layer of ashes testifies to its destruction by fire.
There can be no doubt that the town so destroyed was
that of Hammurabi and his immediate successors, for
the dated tablets were found lying in the layer of
ashes undisturbed. We here have additional proof that
Babylon's First Dynasty ended in disaster. It is
possible that the conflagration, in which the city then
perished, was the work of the Hittite raiders whose
onslaught we know took place in Samsu-ditana's reign.</p>

<p>This portion of the town would appear to have been
entirely residential, as it contains no open space such as
would have served as a market. Even the temples were
without a space in front of them, and in this respect
resemble the churches in many modern cities. It will
be noted that the temple of Ishtar of Akkad in the
north of the Merkes Mound, though not actually built
in, is approached on every side by private houses, though
on its southern face the road is rather broader than elsewhere.
Still more shut in were the temple of Ninib and
the unidentified temple known as "Z," both of which
lie in the mound Ishin-aswad.<a name="FNanchor_185_201" id="FNanchor_185_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_201" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Here trenches cut
across the mound have uncovered the ruins of Babylonian
houses in crude brick, the remains of different
periods lying one above the other as in Merkes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
they surround the temples on all sides. The only other
spot in Babylon where the same strata of streets and
private houses have been found is in a low range of
mounds between the Ḳaṣr and Tell 'Amrân, where the
dwellings appear to be of an inferior character such as
we might expect in a poorer quarter of the town. It is
only in the rather higher ground that satisfactory results
have yet been obtained, as in the plain the earlier strata
descend below water-level. It is possible that further
digging may lay bare the business-quarters of ancient
Babylon, and that we may identify the markets and
bazaars which formed one of the great centres of distribution
in the ancient world.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Merkes Mound has yielded sufficient
evidence to form a general conclusion as to the lines on
which the city was built. The street net-work shown in
the plan is mainly that of the Neo-Babylonian period,
but, wherever the earlier levels were preserved, it was
noted that the old streets followed the same lines with
but slight variations. The main arteries run roughly
north and south, parallel to the course of the Sacred
Way, while others cross them at right angles.<a name="FNanchor_186_202" id="FNanchor_186_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_202" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> It
would appear that, in spite of the absence of open
spaces, we here have a deliberate attempt at town-planning
on a scientific basis, the original idea of which
may be traced back to the First Dynasty. It is true
that the streets are not entirely regular, but the main
thoroughfares all run through, and the island-plots are
all approximately rectangular. We may probably place
this achievement to the credit of the Semitic element in
the population, as in the two Sumerian towns, in which
private house-property has been uncovered, there is no
trace of town-planning. Both at Fâra and at Abû
Hatab, the sites of the early Sumerian cities of Shuruppak
and Kisurra, the streets that have been followed out
are crooked and far more irregular than those of
Babylon. It has long been known that Hammurabi
did much to codify the laws of his country and render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
their administration effective. It would now appear that
similar system and method were introduced at the same
period into the more material side of the national life.</p>

<p>The excavations at Babylon have thus thrown some
direct light upon the condition of the city during the
period at which it first became the capital. It is true
that no portion of a royal or sacred building as yet
identified antedates the later Assyrian Empire, and
that, as the result of extensive reconstruction, the
ruins of temples, palaces and city-walls are mainly
those of the Neo-Babylonian period. But there
was no great break in continuity between that epoch
and its predecessors, so that, when due allowance has
been made for certain innovations, the buildings of the
later period may be treated as typical of Babylonian
civilization as a whole. We have seen how the streets
of Babylon followed the same lines throughout the
whole of her dynastic period, and a similar spirit of conservatism
no doubt characterized her architectural
development. Temples were rebuilt again and again
on the old sites, and even in the Neo-Babylonian period
they retained the mud-brick walls and primitive decoration
of their remote predecessors. Indeed, the conditions
of life in Babylonia precluded any possibility
of drastic change. The increased use of burnt brick in
the upper structure of the royal palaces rendered
possible the brilliant enamelling of the Neo-Babylonian
craftsmen. But, even as late as Nabopolassar's reign,
the thick mud-brick walls of the king's dwelling must
have resembled those of Hammurabi himself: it was
mainly in point of size that the earlier palace and city
differed from those of later monarchs. And when we
examine the successive periods of the country's history,
we shall find that tradition exerted an equally powerful
influence in retaining unaltered the essential features of
the national life. It was under her earliest dynasty that
Babylon worked out in detail a social organization
that suited her agricultural and commercial activities;
and it is a remarkable tribute to its founders that it
should have survived the shock of foreign domination
and have imposed its mould upon later generations.</p>

by Captain J. Felix Jones of the Indian Navy, who did such excellent work
on Nineveh and its neighbourhood (see his "Memoirs," issued as a volume in
"Bombay Government Records," No. XLIII., New Series, Bombay, 1857;
and for the Nineveh survey, cf. "Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc.," Vol. XV., 1853,

incorporated in the India Office Map, which was compiled by Trelawney
Saunders on the basis of the surveys made between 1860 and 1865 by
Commander W. Beaumont Selby, Lieut. W. Collingwood and Lieut. J.
B. Bewsher, all of the Indian Navy. This was issued in 1885 under the
title "Surveys of Ancient Babylon and the surrounding ruins with part of the
rivers Tigris and Euphrates, the Hindiyeh Canal, the Sea of Nejf and the
Shat Atshar," etc., London, 1885. It takes in the area from Baghdad to the
junction of the Shatt Atshar with the Euphrates and is by far the best map,
and the only one on a large scale, hitherto produced of Babylon and its
neighbourhood. All plans of the mounds covering the ruins of the city itself
are of course superseded by those issued by the German expedition.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_12_28" id="Footnote_12_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_28"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Recent discoveries at Shergât prove that a Sumerian occupation of the
site of Ashur preceded the first settlement of the Semitic Assyrians. In a
stratum below the first Ishtar-temple (the earliest Assyrian temple yet
recovered, dating as it does from the close of the third millennium <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>),
several examples of Sumerian sculpture were found which bear an unmistakably
close relationship to the earliest Sumerian work at Tello and Bismâya.
The racial type represented by the sculptures is also that of the south, and
suggests a Sumerian occupation of Assyria before the advent of the Semites.
The termination of their settlement at Ashur was probably not the work of
the Semitic conquerors of Assyria, but of another non-Semitic race akin to
the Mitannian people of Northern Mesopotamia (on this subject see further
Chap. IV., pp. 137 ff.). But the Semites were at least indirect heirs of the
Sumerian inhabitants and derived their culture in part from them; and the
growth of such elements in their acquired civilization would have been
fostered as intercourse with the south increased. For a summary account
of the new discoveries at Ashur, see the "Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft,"
No. 54 (June, 1914).</p></div>

and Weissbach has attempted to use them for a reconstruction of the city
plan. As a result he makes the western portion of the city considerably
smaller than that on the eastern bank, his north-west wall meeting the
Euphrates opposite the Ḳaṣr, and being continued by the elaborate fortification-walls
to the north of the Southern Citadel; cf. "Das Stadtbild von Babylon,"
in "Der alte Orient," V., Heft 4. This represents quite a possible arrangement.
We shall see that these remains of western walls may possibly date from a
still earlier period, and may also have defended the western extension of the
earlier city-area (see below, <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>). But even so they may have remained
the only fortifications on the western bank; for the tendency to expansion
would have been more marked to the east where the main citadel offered
increased possibilities of defence. The fact that Nebuchadnezzar's northern
citadel should also have been built on the left bank points in the same direction.
But the question can only be settled definitely when the traces of these
western walls have been examined by excavation and their relationship to the
eastern fortifications determined.</p></div>

is formed, oddly enough, by the core of the mud-brick portion, which still stands
above the level of the surrounding soil. The far stronger outer wall has completely
disappeared, for its fine burnt-bricks have tempted plunderers in search
of building material. It is only after excavation that the lower courses of its
foundation are detected when still in place. It is possible that deep excavation
may settle the position of the whole line of walls, even where no trace
of them now remains upon the surface.</p></div>

the manner in which bronze may have been used to strengthen and decorate

A. H. 82&mdash;7&mdash;14, 1042) Nebuchadnezzar writes: "For the protection of
E-sagila and Babylon, that sandbanks <i>(pu-ri-im)</i> should not form in the bed of
the Euphrates, I caused a great fortification to be made in the river, of bitumen
and burnt-brick. Its foundation I laid in the abyss, and its head I
raised mountain-high"; cf. Ball, "Troc. Soc. Bibl. Arch.", X., May 1888,

has been found in the later river-wall of Nabonidus. It was perhaps the canal
called in the inscriptions Libil-khegalla, "May it bring abundance." It will
be seen from the plan that the remains of the canal to the south-east show a
narrow channel (P), less than three metres in breadth, but widening westward
of the Sacred Road (G) into a broad basin (R). This represents a reconstruction,
probably of the time of Neriglissar, who built a bridge for the road across
the canal. Formerly the road crossed the canal by a dam with walled
embankments, of which traces have been found below the canal-walls.
Beneath the embankment the water probably flowed through grated sluices
like these spanning Nebuchadnezzar's narrow channel between his river-fortification
and the citadel.</p></div>

with reliefs, may in part be explained by their temporary use in flanking the
roadway during construction. But the decoration of sacred buildings was
not intended merely for the purpose of artistic display. It had a deeper
significance, based on the belief that the use of sacred emblems ensured the
protection of their tutelary deities. And this perhaps offers the best explanation
of the presence of the Weather-god's Bull, and of Marduk's Dragon, upon
the foundation-walls of the building. The lion, Ishtar's own emblem in her
character as the goddess of war, was employed, as we shall see (cf. p. 58),
upon the two walls leading to her gate.</p></div>

Nebuchadnezzar built out as direct extensions of the Southern Citadel upon
its north side, are still in course  of excavation. They have been christened
the "Principal Citadel" and the "Northern Citadel" of the Ḳaṣr. The
most interesting construction yet recovered there is a broad canal (Fig. 18, J),
to the north of the palace-area of the Principal Citadel; this was evidently
left uncovered, and it must have drawn its water-supply from the Euphrates
through grated openings in the western wall. To the east of the roadway
lines of defence were thrown out corresponding to those of the two later
citadels. The foundations of their eastern wall, approximately parallel to the
roadway, have been uncovered; but the whole of this area was destroyed by
the Euphrates when it changed its course, and only the main fortification-walls

<h4>THE DYNASTIES OF BABYLON: THE CHRONOLOGICAL
SCHEME IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT DISCOVERIES</h4>


<p>It has often been said that chronology is the skeleton
of history; and it will be obvious that any flaw in
the chronological scheme must react upon our
conception of the sequence and inter-relation of events.
Perhaps the most serious defect from which Babylonian
chronology has suffered hitherto has been the complete
absence of any established point of contact between the
Babylonian dynasties and those earlier lines of rulers
who exercised authority in cities other than Babylon.
On the one hand, with the help of the Babylonian List
of Kings, we could build up from below a scheme of
the rulers of Babylon itself. On the other hand, after
the discovery of the Nippur Kings' List, it was possible
to establish the succession of the earlier dynasties of
Ur and Nîsin, and to conjecture their relation to the
still more remote rulers of Akkad and other cities in
the north and south. The two halves of the skeleton
were each articulated satisfactorily enough, but the few
bones were wanting which should enable us to fit them
together. It is scarcely necessary to say that there was
no lack of theories for filling in the gap. But every one
of the schemes suggested introduced fresh difficulties of
its own; and to writers of a more cautious temperament
it seemed preferable to avoid a detailed chronology
for those earlier ages. Approximate dates only were
suggested, for, in spite of the obvious temptations presented
by the Nippur List, it was realized that any
attempt to work out the earlier dates in detail was
bound to be misleading. Such writers were content to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
await the recovery of new material and meanwhile to
think in periods.<a name="FNanchor_1_203" id="FNanchor_1_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_203" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is thus with some satisfaction that the announcement
may be made that the connecting link, for which
we have been waiting, has quite recently been established,
with the result that we have now in our hands
the necessary material for reconstructing the chronology
on a sound basis and extending it back without a serious
break, into the middle of the third millennium. The
effect of the newly recovered point of contact between
the earlier and the later phases in the country's history
is naturally of greater importance for the former, so far
as strict chronology is concerned.<a name="FNanchor_2_204" id="FNanchor_2_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_204" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But the information
afforded, as to the overlapping of additional dynasties
with that of the West-Semitic kings of Babylon,
throws an entirely new light upon the circumstances
which led to the rise of Babylon to power. Our picture
of the capital's early history, as an independent city-state
struggling for the mastery of her rivals, ceases to
be an abstraction, and we may now follow her varying
fortunes to their climax in Hammurabi's reign. This
will form the subject of the following chapter; but, as
the new historical material is only now in course of
publication, it will be advisable first to give some
account of it and to estimate its effects upon the
chronological scheme.</p>

<p>It has long been recognized that certain kings of
Larsa, the city in Southern Babylonia now marked by
the mounds of Senkera, were contemporaneous with
the First Dynasty of Babylon. The greatest of these,
Rîm-Sin, a ruler of Elamite extraction, was the contemporary
of Hammurabi, and his signal defeat by
Babylon was commemorated in the date-formula for
the thirty-first year of the latter's reign.<a name="FNanchor_3_205" id="FNanchor_3_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_205" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This victory
was, indeed, the chief event of Hammurabi's reign, and
at one time it was thought that it freed Babylon once
for all from her most powerful enemy. But the discovery
of a chronicle of early Babylonian kings, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
substantiating the fact of Hammurabi's victory, and
affording the additional information that it was followed
by the capture of Ur and Larsa, proved that Rîm-Sin
survived into the reign of Samsu-iluna, Hammurabi's
son, by whom he was finally defeated.<a name="FNanchor_4_206" id="FNanchor_4_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_206" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Another king
of Larsa, Warad-Sin, formerly identified with Rîm-Sin,
was correctly recognized as his brother, both of them
sons of the Elamite Kudur-Mabuk, and successively
kings of the city.<a name="FNanchor_5_207" id="FNanchor_5_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_207" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The names of other rulers were
known from votive texts and foundation-records, and
from this source it was possible to incorporate in the
dynasty Gungunum, probably Sumu-ilum (a king of Ur),
and Nûr-Adad or Nûr-Immer and his son Sin-idinnam.
It was realized that Sin-idinnam, the correspondent to
whom Hammurabi addressed his letters, was not to be
identified with the king of Larsa of that name,<a name="FNanchor_6_208" id="FNanchor_6_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_208" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
all four rulers were provisionally regarded as having
preceded Warad-Sin upon the throne.<a name="FNanchor_7_209" id="FNanchor_7_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_209" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A complete list of the Larsa kings has now been
recovered by Professor A. T. Clay of Yale University,
who is engaged in preparing the text for publication.
The dynasty is seen to have consisted of sixteen kings,
and against the name of each ruler is stated the number
of years he occupied the throne. The surface of the
tablet is damaged in places and the figures against three
of the names are wanting. But this is of no great
consequence, since the scribe has added up the total
number of years enumerated in the list, and states it
at the close as two hundred and eighty-nine.<a name="FNanchor_8_210" id="FNanchor_8_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_210" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> A most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
important point about the list is that the last two kings
of the dynasty are stated to have been Hammurabi and
Samsu-iluna, who, as we know, were the sixth and
seventh rulers of the First Dynasty of Babylon. It is
true that Hammurabi is one of the three kings against
whose names the figures are wanting. But we already
know that he conquered Larsa in his thirty-first year,<a name="FNanchor_9_211" id="FNanchor_9_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_211" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
so that we may confidently regard him as king of that
city for the last twelve years of his reign. The two
remaining kings of the dynasty whose years are missing,
Sin-idinnam and Sin-iḳisham, have thirteen years to
divide between them, and since they are only separated
from each other by the short two-years' reign of Sin-iribam,
the absence of the figures is practically immaterial.
We are thus furnished with the means for
establishing in detail the relationship of the earliest
kings of Babylon to those of Larsa.</p>

<p>But like most new discoveries, this one has brought
a fresh problem in its train. We already suspected that
Rîm-Sin was a long-lived monarch, and we here find
him credited with a reign of sixty-one years. But that
fact would be difficult to reconcile with his survival into
Samsu-iluna's tenth year, which, according to the figures
of the new list, would have fallen eighty-three years
after his accession to the throne. That Rîm-Sin did
survive into the reign of Samsu-iluna seems practically
certain, since the broken passage in the late chronicle,
from which the fact was at first inferred, is supported by
two date-formulæ which can be satisfactorily explained
only on that hypothesis.<a name="FNanchor_10_212" id="FNanchor_10_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_212" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Thus, if he ascended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
throne of Larsa when merely a boy of fifteen, we should
have to infer from the new figures that he was leading
a revolt against Samsu-iluna in his ninety-eighth year&mdash;a
combination of circumstances which is just within the
bounds of possibility, but is hardly probable or convincing.
We shall see presently that there is a comparatively
simple, and not improbable, solution of the
puzzle, to which another line of evidence seems to
converge.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the new list of the kings of
Larsa, important as it undoubtedly is for the history of
its own period, does not in itself supply the long-desired
link between the earlier and the later chronology of
Babylonia. The relationship of the First Dynasty of
Babylon with that of Nîsin<a name="FNanchor_11_213" id="FNanchor_11_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_213" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is, so far as the new list is
concerned, left in the same state of uncertainty as before.
The possibility has long been foreseen that the Dynasty
of Nîsin and the First Dynasty of Babylon overlapped
each other,<a name="FNanchor_12_214" id="FNanchor_12_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_214" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> as was proved to have been the case with
the first dynasties in the Babylonian List of Kings, and
as was confidently assumed with regard to the dynasties
of Larsa and Babylon. That no long interval separated
the two dynasties from one another had been inferred
from the character of the contract-tablets, dating from
the period of the Nîsin Dynasty, which had been found
at Nippur; for these were seen to bear a elose resemblance
to those of the First Babylonian Dynasty in
form, material, writing, and terminology.<a name="FNanchor_13_215" id="FNanchor_13_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_215" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> There were
obvious advantages to be obtained, if grounds could be
produced for believing that the two dynasties were not
only closely consecutive but were partly contemporaneous.
For, in such a case, it would follow that not
only the earlier kings of Babylon, but also the kings
of Larsa, would have been reigning at the same time
as the later kings of Nîsin. In fact, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
picture Babylonia as still divided into a number of
smaller principalities, each vying with the other in a
contest for the hegemony and maintaining a comparatively
independent rule within its own borders.
It was fully recognized that such a condition of
affairs would amply account for the confusion in the
later succession at Nîsin, and our scanty knowledge
of that period could then be combined with the
fuller sources of information on the First Dynasty
of Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_14_216" id="FNanchor_14_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_216" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>In the absence of any definite synchronism, such as
we already possessed for deciding the inter-relations of
the early Babylonian dynasties, other means were tried
in order to establish a point of contact. The capture of
Nîsin by Rîm-Sin, which is recorded in date-formulæ
upon tablets found at Tell Sifr and Nippur, was
evidently looked upon as an event of considerable
importance, since it formed an epoch for dating tablets
in that district. It was thus a legitimate assumption
that the capture of the city by Rîm-Sin should be
regarded as having brought the Dynasty of Nîsin to an
end; such an assumption certainly supplied an adequate
reason for the rise of a new era in time-reckoning.
Now in the date-formulæ of the First Dynasty of
Babylon two captures of the city of Nîsin are commemorated,
the earlier one in that for the seventeenth
year of Sin-muballit, the later in the formula for
Hammurabi's seventh year. Advocates have been
found for deriving each of these dates from the capture
of Nîsin by Rîm-Sin, and so obtaining the desired point
of contact.<a name="FNanchor_15_217" id="FNanchor_15_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_217" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> But the obvious objection to either of
these views is that we should hardly expect a victory by
Rîm-Sin to be commemorated in the date-formulæ of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
his chief rival; and certain attempts to show that
Babylon was at the time the vassal of Larsa have not
proved very convincing. Moreover, if we accept the
earlier identification, it raises the fresh difficulty that
the era of Nîsin was not disturbed by Hammurabi's
conquest of that city. The rejection of both views
thus leads to the same condition of uncertainty from
which we started.</p>

<p>A fresh and sounder line of research has recently
been opened up. A detailed study has been undertaken
of the proper names occurring on contract-tablets from
Nippur, and it was remarked that some of the proper
names found in documents belonging to the Nîsin and
Larsa Dynasties are identical with those appearing on
other Nippur tablets belonging to the First Dynasty of
Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_16_218" id="FNanchor_16_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_218" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> That they were borne by the same individuals
is in many eases quite certain from the fact that the
names of their fathers are also given. Both sets of documents
were not only found at Nippur but were obviously
written there, since they closely resemble one another in
general appearance, style and arrangement. The same
witnesses, too, occur again and again on them, and some
of the tablets, which were drawn up under different
dynasties, are the work of the same scribe. It has even
been found possible, by the study of the proper names,
to follow the history of a family through three generations,
during which it was living at Nippur under
different rulers belonging to the dynasties of Nîsin,
Larsa and Babylon; and one branch of the family can
never have left the city, since its members in successive
generations held the office of "pashishu," or anointing-priest,
in the temple of the goddess Ninlil.<a name="FNanchor_17_219" id="FNanchor_17_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_219" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Of such evidence it will suffice for the moment to
cite two examples, since they have a direct bearing on
the assumption that Rîm-Sin's conquest of Nîsin put an
end to the dynasty in that city. From two of the
documents we learn that Zîatum, the scribe, pursued
his calling at Nippur not only under Damik-ilishu, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
last king of Nîsin, but also under Rîm-Sin of Larsa,<a name="FNanchor_18_220" id="FNanchor_18_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_220" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
a fact which definitely proves that Nippur passed under
the control of these two rulers within the space of one
generation. The other piece of evidence is still more
instructive. It has long been known that Hammurabi
was Rîm-Sin's contemporary, and from the new Kings'
List we have gained the further information that he
succeeded him upon the throne of Larsa. Now two
other of the Nippur documents prove that Ibkushu, the
<i>pashishu,</i> or "anointing-priest" of the goddess Ninlil,
was living at Nippur under Damik-ilishu and also under
Hammurabi in the latter's thirty-first year.<a name="FNanchor_19_221" id="FNanchor_19_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_221" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This fact
not only confirms our former inference, but gives very
good grounds for believing that the close of Damik-ilishu's
reign must have fallen within that of Rîm-Sin.
We may therefore regard it as certain that Rîm-Sin's
conquest of Nîsin, which began a new era for time-reckoning
in central and southern Babylonia, put an
end to the reign of Damik-ilishu and to the Dynasty of
Nîsin, of which he was the last member. In order to
connect the chronology of Babylon with that of Nîsin it
therefore only remains to ascertain at what period in
Rîm-Sin's reign, as King of Larsa, his conquest of
Nîsin took place.</p>

<p>It is at this point that a further discovery of Prof.
Clay has furnished us with the necessary data for a
decision. Among the tablets of the Yale Babylonian
Collection he has come across several documents of
Rîm-Sin's reign, which bear a double-date. In every
case the first half of the double-date corresponds to
the usual formula for the second year of the Nîsin era.
On two of them the second half of the date-formula
equates that year with the eighteenth of some other era,
while on two others the same year is equated with the
nineteenth year.<a name="FNanchor_20_222" id="FNanchor_20_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_222" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It is obvious that we here have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
scribes dating documents according to a new era, and
explaining that that year corresponds to the eighteenth
(or nineteenth) of one with which they had been familiar,
and which the new method of time-reckoning was
probably intended to displace. Now we know that, before
the capture of Nîsin, the scribes in cities under Rîm-Sin's
control had been in the habit of dating documents
by events in his reign, according to the usual practice of
early Babylonian kings.<a name="FNanchor_21_223" id="FNanchor_21_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_223" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> But this method was given up
after the capture of Nîsin, and for at least thirty-one
years after that event the era of Nîsin was in vogue.<a name="FNanchor_22_224" id="FNanchor_22_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_224" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
In the second year of the era, when the new method of
dating had just been settled, it would have been natural
for the scribes to add a note explaining the relationship
of the new era to the old. But, as the old changing
formulæ had been discontinued, the only possible way
to make the equation would have been to reckon
the number of years Rîm-Sin had been upon the throne.
Hence we may confidently conclude that the second
figure in the double-dates was intended to give the year
of Rîm-Sin's reign which corresponded to the second
year of the Nîsin era.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that in some of the documents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
with the double-dates the second figure is given as
eighteen and in others as nineteen. There is more than
one way in which it is possible to explain the discrepancy.
If we assume that the conquest of Nîsin took
place towards the close of Rîm-Sin's seventeenth year,
it is possible that, during the two years that followed,
alternative methods of reckoning were in vogue, some
scribes regarding the close of the seventeenth year as
the first year of the new epoch, others beginning the
new method of time-reckoning with the first day of the
following Nisan. Rut that explanation can hardly be
regarded as probable, for, in view of the importance
attached to the conquest, the promulgation of the
new era commemorating the event would have been
carried out with more than ordinary ceremonial, and the
date of its adoption would not have been left to the calculation
of individual scribes. It is far more likely that
the explanation is to be sought in the second figure of
the equation, the discrepancy being due to alternative
methods of reckoning Rîm-Sin's regnal years. Again
assuming that the conquest took place in Rîm-Sin's
seventeenth year, those scribes who counted the years
from his first date-formula would have made the second
year of the era the eighteenth of his reign. But others
may have included in their total the year of Rîm-Sin's
accession to the throne, and that would account for their
regarding the same year as the nineteenth according to
the abolished system of reckoning.<a name="FNanchor_23_225" id="FNanchor_23_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_225" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This seems the
preferable explanation of the two, but it will be noticed
that, on either alternative, we must regard the first year
of the Nîsin era as corresponding to the seventeenth
year of Rîm-Sin's reign.</p>

<p>One other point requires to be settled, and that is
the relation of the Nîsin era to the actual conquest of
the city. Was the era inaugurated in the same year
as the conquest, or did its first year begin with the
following first of Nisan? In the course of the fifth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
chapter the early Babylonian method of time-reckoning
is referred to, and it will be seen that precisely the
same question arises with regard to certain other
events commemorated in date-formulæ of the period.<a name="FNanchor_24_226" id="FNanchor_24_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_226" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Though some features of the system are still rather
uncertain, we have proof that the greater historical
events did in certain cases affect the current date-formula,
especially when this was of a provisional
character, with the result that the event was commemorated
in the final formula for the year of its
actual occurrence. Arguing from analogy, we may
therefore regard the inauguration of the Nîsin era as
coinciding with the year of the city's capture. In the
case of this particular event the arguments in favour
of such a view apply with redoubled force, for no other
victory by a king of Larsa was comparable to it in
importance. We may thus regard the last year of
Damik-ilishu, King of Nîsin, as corresponding to the
seventeenth year of Rîm-Sin, King of Larsa. And
since the relationship of Rîm-Sin with Hammurabi has
been established by the new list of Larsa kings, we are
at length furnished with the missing synchronism for
connecting the dynasties of the Nippur Kings' List
with those of Babylon.</p>

</div>


<p>We may now return to the difficulty introduced by
the new list of Larsa kings, on which, as we have
already noted, the long reign of Rîm-Sin is apparently
entered as preceding the thirty-second year of Hammurabi's
rule in Babylon. Soon after the publication of
the chronicle, from a broken passage on which it was
inferred that Rîm-Sin survived into Samsu-iluna's reign.<a name="FNanchor_25_227" id="FNanchor_25_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_227" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
an attempt was made to explain the words as referring to
a son of Rîm-Sin and not to that ruler himself.<a name="FNanchor_26_228" id="FNanchor_26_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_228" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But
it was pointed out that the sign, which it was suggested
should be rendered as "son," was never employed with
that meaning in chronicles of the period,<a name="FNanchor_27_229" id="FNanchor_27_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_229" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
must consequently continue to regard the passage as
referring to Rîm-Sin. It was further noted that two
contract-tablets found at Tell Sifr, which record the
same deed of sale, are dated the one by Rîm-Sin, and
the other in Samsu-iluna's tenth year.<a name="FNanchor_28_230" id="FNanchor_28_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_230" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In both of
these deeds the same parties are represented as carrying
out the same transaction, and, although there is a difference
in the price agreed upon, the same list of witnesses
occur on both, and both are dated in the same month.
The most reasonable explanation of the existence of the
two documents would seem to be that, at the period
the transaction they record took place, the possession
of the town now marked by the mounds of Tell Sifr
was disputed by Rîm-Sin and Samsu-iluna. Soon after
the first of the deeds had been drawn up, the town may
have changed hands, and, in order that the transaction
should still be recognized as valid, a fresh copy of the
deed was made out with the new ruler's date-formula
substituted for that which was no longer current.<a name="FNanchor_29_231" id="FNanchor_29_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_231" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> But
whatever explanation be adopted, the alternative dates
upon the documents, taken in conjunction with the
chronicle, certainly imply that Rîm-Sin was living at
least as late as Samsu-iluna's ninth year, and probably
in the tenth year of his reign.</p>

<p>If, then, we accept the face value of the figures given
by the new Larsa Kings' List, we are met by the
difficulty already referred to, that Rîm-Sin would
have been an active political force in Babylonia some
eighty-three years after his own accession to the throne.
And assuming that he was merely a boy of fifteen when
he succeeded his brother at Larsa, he would have been
taking the field against Samsu-iluna in his ninety-eighth
year.<a name="FNanchor_30_232" id="FNanchor_30_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_232" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> But it is extremely unlikely that he was
so young at his accession, and, in view of the improbabilities
involved, it is preferable to scrutinize the figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in the Larsa list with a view to ascertaining whether
they are not capable of any other interpretation.</p>

<p>It has already been noted that the Larsa List is a
contemporaneous document, since the scribe has added
the title of "king" to the last name only, that of
Samsu-iluna, implying that he was the reigning king
at the time the document was drawn up. It is unlikely,
therefore, that any mistake should have been made in
the number of years assigned to separate rulers, the
date-formulæ and records of whose reigns would have
been easily accessible for consultation by the compiler.
The long reign of sixty-one years, with which Rîm-Sin
is credited, must be accepted as correct, for it does not
come to us as a tradition incorporated in a Neo-Babylonian
document, but is attested by a scribe writing
within two years of the time when, as we have seen,
Rîm-Sin was not only living but fighting against the
armies of Babylon. In fact, the survival of Rîm-Sin
throughout the period of Hammurabi's rule at Larsa,
and during the first ten years of Samsu-iluna's reign,
perhaps furnishes us with the solution of our problem.</p>

<p>If Rîm-Sin had not been deposed by Hammurabi
on his conquest of Larsa, but had been retained there
with curtailed powers as the vassal of Babylon, may
not his sixty-one years of rule have included this
period of dependence? In that case he may have ruled
as independent King of Larsa for thirty-nine years,
followed by twenty-two years during which he owed
allegiance successively to Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna,
until in the latter's tenth year he revolted and once
more took the field against Babylon. It is true that,
with the missing figures in the Kings' List restored as
suggested by Professor Clay, the figure for the total
duration of the dynasty may be cited against this explanation;
for the two hundred and eighty-nine years is
obtained by regarding the whole of Rîm-Sin's reign as
anterior to Hammurabi's conquest. There are two
possibilities with regard to the figure. In the first
place it is perhaps just possible that Sin-idinnam and
Sin-iḳîsham may have reigned between them thirty-five
years, in place of the thirteen years provisionally
assigned to them. If that were so, the scribe's total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
would be twenty-two years less than the addition of
his figures, and the discrepancy could only be explained
by some such overlapping as suggested. But it is far
more likely that the figures are correctly restored, and
that the scribe's total corresponds to that of the figures
in the list. On such an assumption it is not improbable
that he mechanically added up the figures placed
opposite the royal names, without deducting from his
total the years of Rîm-Sin's dependent rule.</p>

<p>This explanation appears to be the one least open to
objection, as it does not necessitate the alteration of
essential figures, and merely postulates a natural oversight
on the part of the compiler. The placing of
Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna in the list after, and not
beside, Rîm-Sin would be precisely on the lines of the
Babylonian Kings' List, in which the Second Dynasty
is enumerated between the First and Third, although, as
we now know, it overlapped a part of each. In that
case, too, the scribe has added up the totals of his
separate dynasties, without any indication of their
periods of overlapping. The explanation in both cases
is, of course, that the modern system of arranging
contemporaneous rulers in parallel columns had not
been evolved by the Babylonian scribes. Moreover,
we have evidence that at least one other compiler of a
dynastic list was careless in adding up his totals; from
one of his discrepancies it would seem that he counted
a period of three months as three years, while in
another of his dynasties a similar period of three
months was probably counted twice over both as
months and years.<a name="FNanchor_31_233" id="FNanchor_31_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_233" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It is true that the dynastic list
in question is a late and not a contemporaneous document,
but at least it inclines us to accept the possibility
of such an oversight as that suggested on the part of
the compiler of the Larsa list.</p>

<p>The only reason which we have as yet examined
for equating the first twenty-two years of Babylon's
suzerainty over Larsa with the latter part of Rîm-Sin's
reign has been the necessity of reducing the duration of
that monarch's life within the bounds of probability. If
this had been the only ground for the assumption, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
might perhaps have been regarded as more or less problematical.
But the Nippur contract-tablets and legal
documents, to which reference has already been made,<a name="FNanchor_32_234" id="FNanchor_32_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_234" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
furnish us with a number of separate and independent
pieces of evidence in its support. The tablets contain
references to officials and private people who were
living at Nippur in the reigns of Damik-ilishu, the
last king of Nîsin, and of Rîm-Sin of Larsa, and also
under Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna of Babylon. Most
of the tablets of Rîm-Sin's period are dated by the
Nîsin era, and, since the dates of those drawn up in
the reigns of Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna can be
definitely ascertained by means of their date-formulæ,
it is possible to estimate the intervals of time separating
references to the same man or to a man and his son. It
is remarkable that in some cases the interval of time
appears excessive if the whole of Rîm-Sin's reign of
sixty-one years be placed before Hammurabi's capture
of Larsa. If, on the other hand, we regard Rîm-Sin as
Babylon's vassal for the last twenty-two years of his
rule in Larsa, the intervals of time are reduced to
normal proportions. As the point is of some importance
for the chronology, it may be as well to cite one
or two examples of this class of evidence, in order that
the reader may judge of its value for himself.</p>

<p>The first example we will examine will be that
furnished by Ibkushu, the anointing-priest of Ninlil,
to whom we have already referred as having lived at
Nippur under Damik-ilishu and also under Hammurabi
in the latter's thirty-first year<a name="FNanchor_33_235" id="FNanchor_33_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_235" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; both references, it may
be noted, describe him as holding his priestly office, at
Nippur. Now, if we accept the face value of the figures
in the Larsa List we obtain an interval between these
two references of at least forty-four years and probably
more.<a name="FNanchor_34_236" id="FNanchor_34_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_236" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> By the suggested interpretation of the figures
in the List the interval would be reduced by twenty-two
years. A very similar case is that of the scribe
Ur-kingala, who is mentioned in a document dated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the eleventh year of the Nîsin era, and again in one of
Samsu-iluna's fourth year.<a name="FNanchor_35_237" id="FNanchor_35_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_237" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In the one case we obtain
an interval of fifty years between the two references,
while in the other it is reduced to twenty-eight years.
Very similar results follow if we examine references on
the tablets to fathers and their sons. A certain Adad-rabi,
for example, was living at Nippur under Damik-ilishu,
while his two sons Mâr-irsitim and Mutum-ilu
are mentioned there in the eleventh year of Samsu-iluna's
reign.<a name="FNanchor_36_238" id="FNanchor_36_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_238" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In the one case we must infer an interval
of at least sixty-seven years, and probably more, between
father and sons; in the other an interval of forty-five
years or more is obtained. It will be unnecessary to
examine further examples, as those already cited may
suffice to illustrate the point. It will be noted that
the unabridged interval can in no single instance be
pronounced impossible. But the cumulative effect produced
is striking. The independent testimony of these
private documents and contracts thus converges to the
same point as the data with regard to the length of Rîm-Sin's
life. Several of the figures so obtained suggest that,
taken at their face value, the regnal years in the Larsa
List yield a total that is about one generation too long.
They are thus strongly in favour of the suggested method
of interpreting Rîm-Sin's reign in the Larsa succession.</p>

<p>We may thus provisionally place the sixty-first year of
Rîm-Sin's rule at Larsa in the tenth year of Samsu-iluna's
reign, when we may assume that he revolted and took
the field against his suzerain. It was in that year that
Tell Sifr changed hands for a time. But it is probably
a significant fact that not a single document of Samsu-iluna's
reign has been found in that district dated after
his twelfth year. In fact we shall see reason to believe
that the whole of Southern Babylonia soon passed from
the control of Babylon, though Samsu-iluna succeeded
in retaining his hold on Nippur for some years longer.
Meanwhile it will suffice to note that the suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
sequence of events fits in very well with other references
in the date-lists. The two defeats of Nîsin by
Hammurabi and his father Sin-muballit, which have
formed for so long a subject of controversy, now cease
to be a stumbling-block. We see that both took place
before Rîm-Sin's capture of Nîsin,<a name="FNanchor_37_239" id="FNanchor_37_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_239" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and were merely
temporary successes which had no effect upon the continuance
of the Nîsin dynasty. That was brought to
an end by Rîm-Sin's victory in his seventeenth year,
when the Nîsin era of dating was instituted. That, in
cities where it had been long employed, the continued
use of the era alongside his own formulæ should have
been permitted by Hammurabi for some eight years
after his capture of Larsa, is sufficiently explained by
our assumption that Rîm-Sin was not deposed, but was
retained in his own capital as the vassal of Babylon.
There would have been a natural reluctance to abandon
an established era, especially if Babylon's authority was
not rigidly enforced during the first few years of her
suzerainty, as with earlier vassal states.<a name="FNanchor_38_240" id="FNanchor_38_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_240" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The overlapping of the Dynasty of Nîsin with that
of Babylon for a period of one hundred and eleven
years, which follows from the new information afforded
by the Yale tablets, merely carries the process still
further that was noted some years ago with regard to
the first three Dynasties of the Babylonian List of
Kings. At the time of the earlier discovery considerable
difference of opinion existed as to the number of
years, if any, during which the Second Dynasty of the
List held independent sway in Babylonia. The archæological
evidence at that time available seemed to suggest
that the kings of the Sea-Country never ruled in
Babylonia, and that the Third, or Kassite, Dynasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
followed the First Dynasty without any considerable
break.<a name="FNanchor_39_241" id="FNanchor_39_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_241" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Other writers, in their endeavours to use and
reconcile the chronological references to earlier rulers
which occur in later texts, assumed a period of independence
for the Second Dynasty which varied, according
to their differing hypotheses, from one hundred and
sixty-eight to eighty years.<a name="FNanchor_40_242" id="FNanchor_40_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_242" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Since the period of the
First Dynasty was not fixed independently, the complete
absence of contemporary evidence with regard to
the Second Dynasty led to a considerable divergence of
opinion upon the point.</p>

<p>So far as the archæological evidence is concerned,
we are still without any great body of documents
dated in their reigns, which should definitely prove the
rule of the Sea-Country kings in Babylonia. But two
tablets have now been discovered in the Nippur Collections
which are dated in the second year of Iluma-ilum,
the founder of the Second Dynasty.<a name="FNanchor_41_243" id="FNanchor_41_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_243" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> And this fact
is important, since it proves that for two years at any
rate he exercised control over a great part of Babylonia.
Now among the numerous documents dated in the
reigns of Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna, which have
been found at Nippur, none are later than Samsu-iluna's
twenty-ninth year, although the succession of
dated documents up to that time is almost unbroken.
It would thus appear that after Samsu-iluna's twenty-ninth
year Babylon lost her hold upon Nippur. It is
difficult to resist the conclusion that the power which
drove her northwards was the kingdom of the Sea-Country,
whose founder Iluma-ilum waged successful
campaigns against both Samsu-iluna and his son Abi-eshu',
as we learn from the late Babylonian chronicle.<a name="FNanchor_42_244" id="FNanchor_42_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_244" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Another fact that is probably of equal significance is
that, of the tablets from Larsa and its neighbourhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
none have been found dated after Samsu-iluna's twelfth
year, although we have numerous examples drawn up
during the earlier years of his reign. We may therefore
assume that soon after his twelve years of rule at
Larsa, which are assigned to him on the new Kings'
List,<a name="FNanchor_43_245" id="FNanchor_43_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_245" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> that city was lost to Babylon. And again it is
difficult to resist the conclusion that the Sea-Country
was the aggressor. From Samsu-iluna's own date-formulæ
we know that in his twelfth year "all the
lands revolted" against him.<a name="FNanchor_44_246" id="FNanchor_44_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_246" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> We may therefore with
considerable probability place Iluma-ilum's revolt in that
year, followed immediately by his establishment of an
independent kingdom in the south.<a name="FNanchor_45_247" id="FNanchor_45_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_247" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> He probably soon
gained control over Larsa and gradually pushed northwards
until he occupied Nippur in Samsu-iluna's
twenty-ninth or thirtieth year.</p>

<p class="caption">IX. BRICK OF WARAD-SIN, KING OF LARSA, RECORDING BUILDING
OPERATIONS IN THE CITY OF UR</p>
</div>

<p>Such appears to be the most probable course of
events, so far as it may be determined in accordance
with our new evidence. And since it definitely proves
that the founder of the Second Dynasty of the Kings'
List established, at any rate for a time, an effective
control over southern and central Babylonia, we are
the more inclined to credit the kings of the Sea-Country
with having later on extended their authority farther
to the north. The fact that the compiler of the
Babylonian List of Kings should have included the
rulers of the Sea-Country in that document has always
formed a weighty argument for regarding some of them
as having ruled in Babylonia; and it was only possible
to eliminate the dynasty entirely from the chronological
scheme by a very drastic reduction of his figures for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
some of their reigns. The founder of the dynasty, for
example, is credited with a reign of sixty years, two
other rulers with reigns of fifty-five years, and a fourth
with fifty years. But the average duration of the
reigns in the dynasty is only six years in excess of
that for the First Dynasty, which also consisted of
eleven kings. And, in view of the sixty-one years
credited to Rîm-Sin in the newly recovered Larsa List,
which is a contemporaneous document and not a later
compilation, we may regard the traditional length of the
dynasty as perhaps approximately correct.<a name="FNanchor_46_248" id="FNanchor_46_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_248" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Moreover, in
all other parts of the Kings' List that can be controlled
by contemporaneous documents, the general accuracy of
the figures has been amply vindicated. The balance
of evidence appears, therefore, to be in favour of
regarding the compiler's estimate for the duration of
his Second Dynasty as also resting on reliable tradition.</p>

<p>In working out the chronological scheme it only
remains therefore to fix accurately the period of the
First Dynasty, in order to arrive at a detailed chronology
for both the earlier and the later periods.
Hitherto, in default of any other method, it has been
necessary to rely on the traditions which have come
down to us from the history of Berossus or on chronological
references to early rulers which occur in the
later historical texts. A new method of arriving at the
date of the First Dynasty, in complete independence of
such sources of information, was hit upon three years
ago by Dr. Kugler, the Dutch astronomer, in the
course of his work on published texts that had any
bearing on the history and achievements of Babylonian
astronomy.<a name="FNanchor_47_249" id="FNanchor_47_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_249" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Two such tablets had been found by Sir
Henry Layard at Nineveh and were preserved in the
Kouyunjik Collection of the British Museum. Of
these one had long been published and its contents
correctly classified as a series of astronomical omens
derived from observations of the planet Venus.<a name="FNanchor_48_250" id="FNanchor_48_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_250" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
was certain that this Assyrian text was a copy of an
earlier Babylonian one, since that was definitely stated
in its colophon. The second of the two inscriptions
proved to be in part a duplicate,<a name="FNanchor_49_251" id="FNanchor_49_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_251" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and by using them
in combination Dr. Kugler was able to restore the
original text with a considerable degree of certainty.<a name="FNanchor_50_252" id="FNanchor_50_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_252" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
But a more important discovery was that he succeeded
in identifying precisely the period at which the text
was originally drawn up, and the astronomical observations
recorded. For he noted that in the eighth section
of his restored text there was a chronological note,
dating that section by the old Babylonian date-formula
for the eighth year of Ammi-zaduga, the tenth king of
the First Babylonian Dynasty. As his text contained
twenty-one sections, he drew the legitimate inference
that it gave him a series of observations of the planet
Venus for each of the twenty-one years of Ammi-zaduga's
reign.<a name="FNanchor_51_253" id="FNanchor_51_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_253" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The observations from which the omens were derived
consist of dates for the heliacal rising and setting of the
planet Venus. The date was observed at which the
planet was first visible in the east, the date of her disappearance
was noted, and the duration of her period of
invisibility; similar dates were then observed of her first
appearance in the west as the Evening Star, followed
as before by the dates of her disappearance and her
period of invisibility. The taking of such observations
does not, of course, imply any elaborate astronomical
knowledge on the part of the early Babylonians. This
beautiful planet must have been the first, after the moon,
to attract systematic observation, and thanks to her
nearly circular orbit, no water-clock nor instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
for measuring angles was required. The astrologers
of the period would naturally watch for the planet's first
appearance in the glimmer of the dawn, that they might
read therefrom the will of the great goddess with whom
she was identified. They would note her gradual ascension,
decline and disappearance, and then count the days
of her absence until she reappeared at sunset and repeated
her movements of ascension and decline. Such
dates, with the resulting fortunes of the country, form
the observations noted in the text that was drawn up
in Ammi-zaduga's reign.</p>

<p>It will be obvious that the periodic return of the
same appearance of the planet Venus would not in
itself have supplied us with sufficient means for determining
the period of the observations. But we obtain
additional data if we employ our information with the
further object of ascertaining the relative positions of
the sun and moon. On the one hand the heliacal
risings and settings of Venus are naturally bound up
in a fixed relationship of Venus to the sun; on the other
hand the series of dates by the days of the month
furnishes us with the relative position of the moon with
regard to the sun on the days cited. Without the second
criterion, the first would be of very little use. But, taken
together, the combination of the sun, Venus and the
moon are of the greatest value for fixing the position of
the group of years, covered by the observations, within
any given period of a hundred years or more. Now if
we eliminate the Second Dynasty altogether from the
Babylonian Kings' List, it is certain that Ammi-zaduga's
reign could not have fallen much later than 1800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>;
on the other hand, in view of the ascertained minimum
of overlapping of the First Dynasty by the Second, it
is equally certain that it could not have fallen earlier
than 2060 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The period of his reign must thus be
sought within the interval between these dates. But,
in order to be on the safe side, Dr. Kugler extended
both the limits of the period to be examined; he conducted
his researches within the period from 2080 to
1740 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> He began by taking two observations for
the sixth year of Ammi-zaduga, which gave the dates
for the heliacal setting of Venus in the west and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
rising in the east, and, by using the days of the month
to ascertain the relative positions of the moon, he found
that throughout the whole course of his period this particular
combination took place three times.<a name="FNanchor_52_254" id="FNanchor_52_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_254" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> He then
proceeded to examine in the same way the rest of the
observations, with their dates, as supplied by the two
tablets, and, by working them out in detail for the
central one of his three possible periods, he obtained
confirmation of his view that the observations did cover
a consecutive period of twenty-one years. In order to
obtain independent proof of the correctness of his figures,
he proceeded to examine the dates upon contemporary
legal documents, which could be brought into direct or
indirect relation to the time of harvest. These dates,
according to his interpretation of the calendar, offered
a means of controlling his results, since he was able to
show that a higher or lower estimate tended to throw
out the time of harvest from the month of Nisan, which
was peculiarly the harvest month.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the last part of the
demonstration stands in a different category to the
first; it does not share the simplicity of the astronomical
problem. It formed, indeed, merely an additional
method of testing the interpretation of the astronomical
evidence, and the dates resulting from the latter were
obtained in complete independence of the farming-out
contracts of the period. Taking, then, the three alternative
dates, there can be no doubt, if we accept the
figure of the Kings' List for the Second Dynasty as
approximately accurate, that the central of the three
periods is the only one possible for Ammi-zaduga's
reign; for either of the other two would imply too high
or too low a date for the Third Dynasty of the Kings'
List. We may thus accept the date of 1977 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> as
that of Ammi-zaduga's accession, and we thereby obtain
a fixed point for working out the chronology of the
First Dynasty of Babylon, and, consequently, of the
partly contemporaneous Dynasties of Larsa and of Nîsin,
and of the still earlier Dynasty of Ur. Incidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
it assists in fixing within comparatively narrow limits
the period of the Kassite conquest and of the following
dynasties of Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_53_255" id="FNanchor_53_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_255" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Starting from this figure as
a basis, and making use of the information already
discussed, it would follow that the Dynasty of Nîsin
was founded in the year 2339 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, that of Larsa only
four years later in 2335 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and the First Dynasty of
Babylon after a further interval of a hundred and ten
years in 2225 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_54_256" id="FNanchor_54_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_256" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>It will have been seen that the suggested system of
chronology has been settled in complete independence
of the chronological notices to earlier rulers which have
come down to us in the inscriptions of some of the later
Assyrian and Babylonian kings. Hitherto these have
furnished the principal starting points, on which reliance
has been placed to date the earlier periods in the history
of Babylon. In the present case it will be pertinent
to examine them afresh and ascertain how far they
harmonize with a scheme which has been evolved without
their help. If they are found to accord very well
with the new system, we may legitimately see in such
an agreement additional grounds for believing we are
on the right track. Without pinning one's faith too
slavishly to any calculation by a native Babylonian
scribe, the possibility of harmonizing such references
at least removes a number of difficulties, which it has
always been necessary either to ignore or to explain away.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chronological notice which has given
rise to most discussion is the one in which Nabonidus
refers to the period of Hammurabi's reign. On one of
his foundation-cylinders Nabonidus states that Hammurabi
rebuilt E-babbar, the temple of the Sun-god
in Larsa, seven hundred years before Burna-Buriash.<a name="FNanchor_55_257" id="FNanchor_55_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_257" class="fnanchor">[55]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
At a time when it was not realized that the First and
Second Dynasties of the Kings' List were partly contemporaneous,
the majority of writers were content to
ignore the apparent inconsistency between the figures
of the Kings' List and this statement of Nabonidus.
Others attempted to get over the difficulty by emending
the figures in the List and by other ingenious
suggestions; for it was felt that to leave a discrepancy
of this sort without explanation pointed to a possibility
of error in any scheme necessitating such a course.<a name="FNanchor_56_258" id="FNanchor_56_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_258" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
We will see, then, how far the estimate of Nabonidus
accords with the date assigned to Hammurabi under
our scheme. From the Tell el-Amarna letters we
know that Burna-Buriash was the contemporary of
Amen-hetep IV., to whose accession most historians of
Egypt now agree to assign a date in the early part
of the fourteenth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_57_259" id="FNanchor_57_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_259" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> We may take 1480 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
as representing approximately the date which, according
to the majority of the schemes of Egyptian chronology,
may be assigned to Amen-hetep IV.'s accession. And
by adding seven hundred years to this date we obtain,
according to the testimony of Nabonidus, a date for
Hammurabi of about 2080 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> According to our
scheme the last year of Hammurabi's reign fell in
2081 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and, since the seven hundred years of
Nabonidus is obviously a round number, its general
agreement with the scheme is remarkably close.<a name="FNanchor_58_260" id="FNanchor_58_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_260" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The chronological notice of Nabonidus thus serves
to confirm, so far as its evidence goes, the general
accuracy of the date assigned to the First Dynasty. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the case of the Second Dynasty we obtain an equally
striking confirmation, when we examine the only available
reference to the period of one of its kings which is
found in the record of a later ruler. The passage in
question occurs upon a boundary-stone preserved in
the University Museum of Pennsylvania, referring to
events which took place in the fourth year of Enlil-nadin-apli.<a name="FNanchor_59_261" id="FNanchor_59_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_261" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
In the text engraved upon the stone it is
stated that 696 years separated Gulkishar (the sixth
king of the Second Dynasty) from Nebuchadnezzar, who
is of course to be identified with Nebuchadnezzar I., the
immediate predecessor of Enlil-nadin-apli upon the
throne of Babylon. Now we know from the "Synchronistic
History" that Nebuchadnezzar I. was the
contemporary of Ashur-rêsh-ishi, the father of Tiglath-pileser
I., and if we can establish independently the date
of the latter's accession, we obtain approximate dates
for Nebuchadnezzar and consequently for Gulkishar.</p>

<p>In his inscription on the rock at Bavian Sennacherib
tells us that 418 years elapsed between the defeat of
Tiglath-pileser I. by Marduk-nadin-akhê and his own
conquest of Babylon in 689 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_60_262" id="FNanchor_60_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_262" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Tiglath-pileser was
therefore reigning in 1107 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and we know from his
Cylinder-inscription that this year was not among the
first five of his reign; on this evidence the beginning of
his reign has been assigned approximately to 1120 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
Nebuchadnezzar I., the contemporary of Tiglath-pileser's
father, may thus have come to the throne at about
1140 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; and, by adding the 696 years to this date,
we obtain an approximate date of 1836 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> as falling
within the reign of Gulkishar of the Second Dynasty.
This date supports the figures of the Kings' List, according
to which Gulkishar would have been reigning from
about 1876 to 1822 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> But it should be noted that
the period of 696 years upon the boundary-stone, though
it has an appearance of great accuracy, was probably
derived from a round number; for the stone refers to
events which took place in Enlil-nadin-apli's fourth
year, and the number 696 may have been based upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the estimate that seven hundred years separated Enlil-nadin-apli's
reign from that of Gulkishar. It is thus
probable that the reference should not be regarded as
more than a rough indication of the belief that a portion
of Gulkishar's reign fell within the second half of the
nineteenth century. But, even on this lower estimate
of the figure's accuracy, its agreement with our scheme
is equally striking.</p>

<p>One other chronological reference remains to be
examined, and that is the record of Ashur-bani-pal,
who, when describing his capture of Susa in about
647 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, relates that he recovered the image of the
goddess Nanâ, which the Elamite Kudur-Nankhundi
had carried off from Erech sixteen hundred and thirty-five
years before.<a name="FNanchor_61_263" id="FNanchor_61_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_263" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> This figure would assign to Kudur-Nankhundi's
invasion an approximate date of 2282 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
As we possess no other reference to, nor record of, an
early Elamite king of this name, there is no question of
harmonizing this figure with other chronological records
bearing on his reign. All that we can do is to ascertain
whether, according to our chronological scheme, the
date 2282 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> falls within a period during which an
Elamite king would have been likely to invade Southern
Babylonia and raid the city of Erech. Tested in this
way, Ashur-bani-pal's figure harmonizes well enough
with the chronology, for Kudur-Nankhundi would have
invaded Babylonia fifty-seven years after a very similar
Elamite invasion which brought the Dynasty of Ur to
an end, and gave Nîsin her opportunity of securing the
hegemony.<a name="FNanchor_62_264" id="FNanchor_62_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_264" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> That Elam continued to be a menace
to Babylonia is sufficiently proved by Kudur-Mabuk's
invasion, which resulted in placing his son Warad-Sin
upon the throne of Larsa in 2143 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It will be noted
that Ashur-bani-pal's figure places Kudur-Nankhundi's
raid on Erech in the period between the two most
notable Elamite invasions of early Babylonia, of which
we have independent evidence.</p>

<p>Another advantage of the suggested chronological
scheme is that it enables us to clear up some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
problems presented by the dynasties of Berossus, at least
so far as concerns the historical period in his system of
chronology. In a later historian of Babylon we should
naturally expect to find that period beginning with the
first dynasty of rulers in the capital; but hitherto the
available evidence did not seem to suggest a date that
could be reconciled with his system. It may be worth
while to point out that the date assigned under the new
scheme for the rise of the First Dynasty of Babylon
coincides approximately with that deduced for the beginning
of the historical period in Berossus. Five of
the historical dynasties of Berossus, following his first
dynasty of eighty-six kings who ruled for 34,090 years
after the Deluge,<a name="FNanchor_63_265" id="FNanchor_63_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_265" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> are preserved only in the Armenian
version of the Chronicles of Eusebius<a name="FNanchor_64_266" id="FNanchor_64_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_266" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%;">
Dynasty II., 8 Median usurpers, ruling 224 years;<a name="FNanchor_65_267" id="FNanchor_65_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_267" class="fnanchor">[65]</a><br />
Dynasty III., 11 kings, the length of their rule wanting;<a name="FNanchor_66_268" id="FNanchor_66_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_268" class="fnanchor">[66]</a><br />
Dynasty IV., 49 Chaldean kings, ruling 458 years;<br />
Dynasty V., 9 Arab kings, ruling for 245 years;<br />
Dynasty VI., 45 kings, ruling for 526 years.<br />
</p>

<p>It is not quite clear to what stage in the national
history Berossus intended his sixth dynasty to extend;<a name="FNanchor_67_269" id="FNanchor_67_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_269" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
and in any case, the fact that the figure is wanting for
the length of his third dynasty, renders their total duration
a matter of uncertainty. But, in spite of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
drawbacks, a general agreement has been reached as
to a date for the beginning of his historical period, based
on considerations independent of the figures in detail.
A. von Gutschmid's suggestion that the kings after the
Deluge were grouped by Berossus in a cycle of ten <i>sars,
i.e.</i> 36,000 years,<a name="FNanchor_68_270" id="FNanchor_68_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_270" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> furnished the key that has been used
for solving the problem. For, if the first dynasty be
subtracted from this total, the remaining number of
years would give the total length of the historical
dynasties. Thus, if we take the length of the first
dynasty as 34,090 years, the duration of the historical
dynasties is seen to have been 1910 years. Now the
statement attributed to Abydenus by Eusebius, to the
effect that the Chaldeans reckoned their kings from
Alorus to Alexander,<a name="FNanchor_69_271" id="FNanchor_69_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_271" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> has led to the suggestion that
the period of 1910 years was intended to include the
reign of Alexander the Great (331-323 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>). If therefore
we add 1910 years to 322 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, we obtain 2232 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
as the beginning of the historical period with which the
second dynasty of Berossus opened. It may be added
that the same result has been arrived at by taking
34,080 years as the length of his first dynasty,<a name="FNanchor_70_272" id="FNanchor_70_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_272" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and by
extending the historical period of 1920 years down to
312 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the beginning of the Seleucid Era.</p>

<p>Incidentally it may be noted that this date has been
harmonized with the figure assigned in the margin of
some manuscripts as representing the length of tin
third dynasty of Berossus. It has usually been held
that his sixth dynasty ended with the predecessor of
Nabonassar upon the throne of Babylon, and that the
following or seventh dynasty would have begun in
747 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> But it has been pointed out that, after
enumerating the dynasties II.-VI., Eusebius goes on
to say that after these rulers came a king of the
Chaldeans whose name was Phulus<a name="FNanchor_71_273" id="FNanchor_71_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_273" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>; and this phrase
has been explained as indicating that the sixth dynasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of Berossus ended at the same point as the Ninth
Babylonian Dynasty, in 732 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, that is to say, with
the reign of Nabû-shum-ukîn, the contemporary of
Tiglath-pileser IV., whose original name of Pulu is
preserved in the Babylonian List of Kings. Thus the
seventh dynasty of Berossus would have begun with the
reign of the usurper Ukîn-zêr, who was also the contemporary
of Tiglath-pileser.<a name="FNanchor_72_274" id="FNanchor_72_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_274" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> On this supposition the
figure "forty-eight," which occurs in the margin of
certain manuscripts of the Armenian version of Eusebius,<a name="FNanchor_73_275" id="FNanchor_73_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_275" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
may be retained for the number of years assigned
by Berossus to his third dynasty.<a name="FNanchor_74_276" id="FNanchor_74_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_276" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> A further confirmation
of the date 2232 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> for the beginning of the
historical period of Berossus has been found in a statement
derived from Porphyrins, to the effect that,
according to Callisthenes, the Babylonian records of
astronomical observations extended over a period of
1903 years down to the time of Alexander of Macedon.<a name="FNanchor_75_277" id="FNanchor_75_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_277" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Assuming that the reading 1903 is correct, the observations
would have extended back to 2233 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, a date
differing by only one year from that obtained for the
beginning of Berossus' historical dynasties.</p>

<p>Thus there are ample grounds for regarding the
date 2232 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> as representing the beginning of the historical
period in the chronological system of Berossus;<a name="FNanchor_76_278" id="FNanchor_76_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_278" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
and we have already noted that in a late Babylonian
historian, writing during the Hellenistic period, we
should expect the beginning of his history, in the
stricter sense of the term, to coincide with the first
recorded dynasty of Babylon, as distinct from rulers
of other and earlier city-states. It will be observed that
this date is only seven years out with that obtained
astronomically by Dr. Kugler for the rise of the First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Dynasty of Babylon. Now the astronomical demonstration
relates only to the reign of Ammi-zaduga, who
was the tenth king of the First Dynasty; and to obtain
the date 2225 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> for Sumu-abum's accession, reliance is
naturally placed on figures for the intermediate reigns
which are supplied by the contemporaneous date-lists.
But the Babylonian Kings' List gives figures which
were current in the Neo-Babylonian period; and, by
employing it in place of contemporaneous records, we
obtain the date 2229 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> for Sumu-abum's accession,
which presents a discrepancy of only three years to
that deduced from Berossus. In view of the slight
inconsistencies with the Kings' List which we find in
at least one of the late chronicles, it is clear that the
native historians, who compiled their records during the
later periods, found a number of small variations in
the chronological material on which they had to rely.
While there was probably agreement on the general
lines of the later chronology, the traditional length of
some reigns and dynasties might vary in different documents
by a few years. We may conclude therefore
that the evidence of Berossus, so far as it can be reconstituted
from the summaries preserved in other works,
may be harmonized with the date obtained independently
for the First Dynasty of Babylon.</p>

<p>The new information, which has been discussed in
this chapter, has enabled us to carry further than was
previously possible the process of reconstructing the
chronology; and we have at last been able to connect
the earlier epochs in the country's history with those
which followed the rise of Babylon to power. On the
one hand we have obtained definite proof of the overlapping
of further dynasties with that of the West
Semitic kings of Babylon. On the other hand, the
consequent reduction in date is more than compensated
by new evidence pointing to the probability of a period
of independent rule in Babylonia on the part of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of the Sea-Country kings. The general effect of the
new discoveries is thus of no revolutionary character.
It has resulted, rather, in local rearrangements, which
to a considerable extent are found to counterbalance
one another in their relation to the chronological
scheme as a whole. Perhaps the most valuable result
of the regrouping is that we are furnished with the
material for a more detailed picture of the gradual rise
of Babylon to power. We shall see that the coming
of the Western Semites effected other cities than
Babylon, and that the triumph of the invaders marked
only the closing stage of a long and varied struggle.</p>

it would probably be printed off before his own work left the press, Professor
Clay very kindly sent me a transcript of his Larsa Kings' List with full permission
to make use of it. To enable the reader to follow the argument
with regard to the dynasty and its chronology, the following transliteration
and rendering may be given of the text: "21 MU Na-ap-la-nu-um | 28 MU
E-mi-su I 35 MU Sa-mn-um | 9 MU Za-ba-aia | 27 MU Gu-un-gu-nu-um | 11 MU
A-bi-sa-ri-e | 29 MU Su-mu-ilum | 16 MU Nu-ur-(ilu)Adad | 7 (?) MU (ilu)Sin-idin-nam
| 2 MU (ilu)Sin-i-ri-ba-am | 6(?) MU(ilu)Sin-i-ki-sha-am | 1 MU Sili(li)-(ilu)Adad | 12 MU Warad-(ilu)Sin | 61 MU (ilu)Ri-im-(ilu)Sin | 12 (?) MU
(ilu)Ha-am-mu-ra-bi | 12 MU Sa-am-su-i-lu-na sharru | 289 MU-III." In the
translation that follows, a semicolon separates each line of the text: "21 years
Naplanum; 28 years Emisa; 35 years Samum; 9 years Zabâia; 27 years
Gungunum; 11 years Abi-sarê; 29 years Sumu-ilum; 10 years Nûr-Adad;
7(?) years Sin-idinnam; 2 years Sin-iribam; 6(?) years Sin-iḳîsham; 1 year
Sili-Adad; 12 years Warad-Sin; 61 years Rîm-Sin; 12(?) years Hammurabi;
12 years Samsu-iluna, the king; 289 the years thereof." From the insertion
of the word <i>sharru,</i> "king," after Samsu-iluna's name, we may infer that the
list is a contemporaneous document, drawn up in Samsu-iluna's twelfth year.
Another point of interest is that the scribe has written the determinative for
divinity before the names of Rîm-Sin and Hammurabi, but not before that of
Samsu-iluna. The numbers followed by a query are those suggested by
Professor Clay for the three broken passages; it will be noted that they
make up the total of the figures, which is given by the scribe as two hundred
and eighty-nine years.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_20_222" id="Footnote_20_222"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_222"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Professor Clay has written to inform me that on the two tablets Y.<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
Nos. 4229 and 4270, the usual formula for the second year of the Nîsin era is
followed by the words <i>shag mu ki XVIII-kam,</i> which may be rendered "within
the eighteenth year," <i>i.e.</i> corresponding to the eighteenth year. On one tablet
the addition to the usual date takes the form <i>shag mu ki XVIII-kam in-ag (?),</i>
but Prof. Clay is not quite certain of the reading of the sign <i>ag,</i> which, he
writes, "because the tablet was cased, is badly twisted." If the reading is
correct it is important, for the addition may then be rendered "within (<i>i.e.</i>
corresponding to) the eighteenth year that he reigned," the word <i>in-ag</i> being
the verb usually employed in Sumerian dynastic lists in sentences stating the
number of years a king reigned. Two other long date-formulæ for the same
year (on tablets Y.<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, Nos. 4307 and 4481) begin as follows: <i>mu ki II dim(?)
mu ki XIX giš-ku-makh Ana (dingir) En-lil (dingir) En-ki,</i> etc. Here the
reading of the sign <i>dim</i> is not absolutely certain, but, assuming its correctness,
the formula may be rendered: "The second year (corresponding to the nineteenth
year) in which with the exalted weapon of Anu, Enlil and Ea, Rîm-Sin
the king took the city of Nîsin," etc. It will be seen that the readings,
which are suggested by Prof. Clay for the two uncertain signs in the formulæ,
give excellent sense, and, if correct, they definitely prove that the second
figures in the equations were derived from Rîm-Sin's regnal years. Hut, even
if we regard the two signs as quite uncertain, the general interpretation of the
double-dates is not affected; it would be difficult to explain them on any
other hypothesis than that adopted in the text.</p></div>

among the tablets of the Yale Babylonian Collection is one dated in the thirty-first

whether the accession-year should be included in their reckoning. Thus the
apparent discrepancy in the double-dates, so far from weakening the explanation
put forward in the text, really affords it additional support and
confirmation.</p></div>

of Samsu-iluna. As he is credited by the Kings' List with a reign of sixty
years, it is possible, if we accept that figure, that he had established his
dynasty in the Sea-Country some years before attacking Larsa. His accession
has been placed as early as Hammurabi's twenty-sixth year (cf. Thureau-Dangin,
"Zeits. für Assyr.," XXI., pp. 176 ff.), though the same writer, by
making a reduction of twenty years in his dates for the Third and Second
Dynasties, afterwards assumed that he secured his throne in Samsu-iluna's
fourth year  (<i>op. cit.,</i> p. 185 f.). As we have no evidence that Iluma-ilum was
Hammurabi's contemporary, it is safer to place his accession in Samsu-iluna's
reign; and, in that case, the date-formula for the twelfth year appears to
offer the most probable occasion for his revolt.</p></div>

dynasty of semi-mythical kings has been strikingly confirmed by documents
discovered recently in the Niffer Collection of tablets preserved in the
Pennsylvania Museum. These have been published by Poebel, "Univ. of
Pennsyl. Mus. Publications," Vol. IV., No. I, and Vol. V., and the new
information they furnish is of great interest for the earlier history. It may be
noted that the figure 34,090 is that given for the duration of the dynasty in
Syncellus (ed. Dindorf, p. 147); in the equivalent in sars, etc., which is added
(<i>i.e.</i> 9 <i>sars,</i> 2 <i>ners,</i> and 8 <i>soss</i> = 34,080 years),
it is probable that the units are
intentionally ignored, though some would regard 34,080 as the correct figure
(see below, <a href="#Page_115">p. 115</a>). In Eusebius ("Chron. lib. I.," ed. Schoene, Col. 25) the
figure is 33,091 (probably a mistake for 34,091); this figure at any rate confirms
the reading of ninety (against eighty) in Syncellus, cf. Meyer, "Beiträge

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h5>


<h4>THE WESTERN SEMITES AND THE FIRST DYNASTY OF BABYLON</h4>


<p>The rise of Babylon to a position of pre-eminence
among the warring dynasties of Sumer and
Akkad may be regarded as sealing the final
triumph of the Semite over the Sumerian. His survival
in the long racial contest was due to the reinforcements
he received from men of his own stock, whereas the
Sumerian population, when once settled in the country,
was never afterwards renewed. The great Semitic
wave, under which the Sumerian sank and finally disappeared,
reached the Euphrates from the coast-lands
of the Eastern Mediterranean. But the Amurru, or
Western Semites, like their predecessors in Northern
Babylonia, had come originally from Arabia. For it
is now generally recognized that the Arabian peninsula
was the first home and cradle of the Semitic peoples.
Arabia, like the plains of Central Asia, was, in fact,
one of the main breeding-grounds of the human race,
and during the historic period we may trace four great
migrations of Semitic nomad tribes, which successively
broke away from the northern margin of the
Arabian pasture-lands and spread over the neighbouring
countries like a flood. The first great racial movement
of the kind is that of which the effects were chiefly
apparent in Akkad, or Northern Babylonia, where the
Semites first obtained a footing when overrunning the
valley of the Tigris and Euphrates. The second is distinguished
from the first, as the Canaanite or Amorite,
since it gave to Canaan its Semitic inhabitants; but
how long an interval separated the one movement from
the other it is impossible to say. The process may well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
have been a continuous one, with merely a change in
the direction of advance; but it is convenient to distinguish
them by their effects as separate movements,
the sensitization of Canaan following that of Babylonia,
but at the same time contributing to its complete
success. Of the later migrations we are not for the
moment concerned, and in any case only one of them
falls within the period of this history. That was the
third great movement, which began in the fourteenth
century and has been termed the Aramean from the
kingdom it established in Syria with its capital at
Damascus. The fourth, and last, took place in the
seventh century of our own era, when the armies of
Islam, after conquering Western Asia and Northern
Africa, penetrated even to South-Western Europe. It
was by far the most extensive of the four in the area
it covered, and, in spite of being the last of the series,
it illustrates the character and methods of the earlier
movements in their initial stages, when the desert
nomad, issuing in force from his own borders, came
within the area of settled civilization.</p>

<p>It is true that great tracts of Central Arabia are
to-day quite uninhabitable, but there is reason to believe
that its present condition of aridity was not so marked
in earlier periods. We have definite proof of this in
the interior of Southern Arabia, where there is still a
belt of comparatively fertile country between the flat
coastal regions and the steep mountain range, that
forms the southern boundary of the central plateau.<a name="FNanchor_1_279" id="FNanchor_1_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_279" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
On the coast itself there is practically no rainfall,
and even on the higher slopes away from the coast
it is very scanty. Here the herds of goats frequently
go without water for many weeks, and they have learnt
to pull up and chew the fleshy roots of a species of
cactus to quench their thirst. But further still inland
there is a broad belt of country, which is marvellously
fertile and in a high state of cultivation. The rainfall
there is regular during a portion of the year, the country
is timbered, and the main mountain range, though
possessing no towns of any size, is thickly dotted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
strong fighting towers, which dominate the well-farmed
and flourishing villages. To the north of the range,
beyond the cultivation, is a belt roamed over by the
desert-nomads with their typical black tents of woven
goat-hair, and then comes the central desert, a region
of rolling sand. But here and there the ruins of
palaces and temples may still be seen rising from the
sand or built on some slight eminence above its level.</p>

<p>At the time of the Sabæan kingdom, as early as the
sixth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, this region of Southern Arabia must
have been far more fertile than it is at the present
day. The shifting sand, under the driving pressure of
the simoom, doubtless played its part in overwhelming
tracts of cultivated country; but that alone cannot
account for the changed conditions. The researches of
Stein, Pumpelly, Huntington and others have shown
the results of desiccation in Central Asia,<a name="FNanchor_2_280" id="FNanchor_2_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_280" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>and it is
certain that a similar diminution of the rainfall has
taken place in the interior of Southern Arabia.<a name="FNanchor_3_281" id="FNanchor_3_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_281" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> To
such climatic changes, which seem, according to the
latest theories, to occur in recurrent cycles,<a name="FNanchor_4_282" id="FNanchor_4_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_282" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> we may
probably trace the great racial migrations from Central
Arabia, which have given their inhabitants to so many
countries of Western Asia and North Africa.</p>

<p>It is possible to form a very clear picture of the
Semite who issued from this region, for the life of the
pastoral nomad, all the world over, is the same.<a name="FNanchor_5_283" id="FNanchor_5_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_283" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And
even at the present day, in the hollows of the Arabian
desert, there is enough deposit of moisture to allow
of a sufficient growth of grass for pasture-lands, capable
of supporting nomadic tribes, who move with their
flocks of sheep and goats from one more favoured area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
to another. The life of such a nomad is forced into
one mould by the conditions imposed by the desert;
for the grass-land cannot support him and he must
live on the milk and young of his flocks. He is purely
a shepherd, carrying with him the simplest and lightest
tents, tools, and weapons for his needs. The type of
society is that of the patriarchal family, for each nomad
tribe consists of a group of relatives; and, under the
direction of their chief, not only the men of the clan,
but the women and children, all take an active part in
tending the flocks and in practising the simple arts of
skin-curing and the weaving of hair and wool. So long
as the pasture-lands can support his flocks, the nomad
is content to leave the settled agriculturist beyond the
desert edge in peace. Some of the semi-nomad tribes
upon the margin of the cultivation may engage in
barter with their more civilised neighbours, and even
at times demand subsidies for leaving their crops in
peace. But the bulk of the tribes would normally
remain within their own area, while conditions existed
which were capable of supplying the needs of their
simple life. It is when the pasture lands dry up that
the nomad must leave his own area or perish, and it is
then that he descends upon the cultivation and proceeds
to adapt himself to new conditions, should he
conquer the settled races whose higher culture he himself
absorbs.</p>

<p>While still held within the grip of the desert, there
was never any prospect of his development or advance
in civilization. The only great changes that have taken
place in the life of the Arabian nomad have been due to
the introduction of the horse and the camel. But these
have merely increased his mobility, while leaving the
man himself unchanged. The Arabs of the seventh
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, depicted in the reliefs from Nineveh
as fleeing on their camels before the advance of the
Assyrians, can have differed in no essential feature from
their earliest predecessors, who made their way to the
Euphrates valley on foot or with only the ass as a beast
of burden. For, having once succeeded in domesticating
his flocks and in living by their means upon the
rolling steppes of pasture-land, the nomad's needs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
fully satisfied, and his ways of life survive through
succeeding generations. He cannot accumulate possessions,
as he must be able to carry all his goods continually
with him, and his knowledge of the uneventful
past is derived entirely from oral tradition. The earliest
inscriptions recovered in Arabia are probably not anterior
to the sixth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and they were naturally not the
work of nomads, but of Semitic tribes who had forsaken
their wanderings for the settled life of village and township
in the more hospitable regions of the south.</p>

<p>The Amurru, or Western Semites, to whose incursion
into Babylonia the rise of Babylon itself was directly
due, had long abandoned a nomadic existence, and in
addition to the higher standards of the agriculturist had
acquired a civilization which had been largely influenced
by that of Babylonia. Thanks to the active policy of
excavation, carried out during the last twenty-five years
in Palestine, we are enabled to reconstruct the conditions
of life which prevailed in that country from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
very early period. It is, in fact, now possible to trace
the successive stages of Canaanite civilization back to
neolithic times. Rude flint implements of the palaeolithic
or Older Stone Age have also been found on the
surface of the plains of Palestine, where they had lain
since the close of the glacial epoch. But at that time
the climate and character of the Mediterranean lands
were very different to their present condition; and a
great break of unknown length then occurs in the
cultural sequence, which separates that primæval period
from the neolithic or Later Stone Age. It is to this
second era that we may trace the real beginnings of
Canaanite civilization. For, from that time onwards,
there is no break in the continuity of culture, and each
age was the direct heir of that which preceded it.</p>

<p>The neolithic inhabitants of Canaan, whose implements
of worked and polished stone mark a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
advance upon the rough flints of their remote predecessors,
belonged to the short, dark-skinned race which
spread itself over the shores of the Mediterranean.
Dwelling in rude huts, they employed for household
use rough vessels of kneaded clay which they fashioned
by hand and baked in the fire. They lived chiefly by
the cattle and flocks they had domesticated, and, to
judge by their clay spindle-whorls, they practised a
simple form of weaving, and began to clothe themselves
with cloth in place of skins. Over these primitive
inhabitants a fresh tide of migration swept, probably in
the early part of the third millennium <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The new-comers
were Semites from Arabia, of the same stock
as those nomadic hordes who had already overrun
Babylonia and had established themselves in a great
part of that country. After they had settled in Canaan
and Syria they were known to the Babylonians as the
Amurru or Amorites. They were taller and more
vigorous than the neolithic Canaanites, and they seem
to have brought with them a knowledge of the use of
metal, acquired probably by traffic with southern
Babylonia.<a name="FNanchor_6_284" id="FNanchor_6_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_284" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The flint arrows and knives of their
enemies would have had little chance against weapons
of copper and bronze. But, whether helped by their
superior armament or not, they became the dominant
race in Canaan. By intermarrying with their predecessors
they produced the Canaanites of history, a people
of Semitic speech, but with a varying admixture in
their blood of the dark-skinned Mediterranean race of
lower type.</p>

<p>Such in origin was the Canaanite branch of the
Western Semites, and it may be worth while to glance
for a moment at the main features of their culture as
revealed by excavation in Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_7_285" id="FNanchor_7_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_285" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> One thing stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
out clearly: they revolutionized conditions of life in
Canaan. The rude huts of the first settlers were superseded
by houses of brick and stone, and, in place of
villages, cities rose surrounded by massive walls. The
city-wall of Gezer was more than thirteen feet thick
and was defended by strong towers. That of Megiddo
was twenty-six feet in thickness, and its foot was further
protected by a slope, or <i>glacis,</i> of beaten earth. To
secure their water-supply in time of siege, the arrangements
were equally thorough. At Gezer, for example,
a huge tunnel was found, hewn in the solid rock, which
gave access to an abundant spring of water over ninety
feet below the surface of the ground. Not only had
the earlier nomad adopted the agricultural life, but he
soon evolved a system of defence for his settlements,
suggested by the hilly character of his new country and
its ample supply of stone.<a name="FNanchor_8_286" id="FNanchor_8_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_286" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Not less remarkable is the
light thrown by the excavations on details of Canaanite
worship. The centre of each town was the high place,
where huge monoliths were erected, some of them,
when unearthed, still worn and polished by the kisses
of their worshippers. At Gezer ten such monoliths
were discovered in a row, and it is worth noting that
they were erected over a sacred cave of the neolithic
inhabitants, proving that the ancient sanctuary was
taken over by the Semitic invaders. The religious
centres inherited by the Ba'alîm, or local "Lords" of
Canaanite worship, had evidently been sanctified by
long tradition. In the soil beneath the high places
both at Gezer and at Megiddo numbers of jars were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
found containing the bodies of children, and we may
probably see in this fact evidence of infant-sacrifice,
the survival of which into later periods is attested by
Hebrew tradition. In the cultural remains of these
Semitic invaders a distinct development is discernible.
During the earlier period there is scarcely a trace of
foreign influence, but later on we find importations
from both Babylonia and Egypt.</p>

<p>It is but natural that southern and central Canaan
should have long remained inaccessible to outside influence,
and that the effects of Babylonian civilization
should have been confined at first to eastern Syria and
to the frontier districts scattered along the middle
course of the Euphrates. Recent digging by natives
so far to the north as the neighbourhood of Carchemish,
for example, have revealed some remarkable traces of
connexion with Babylonia at a very early period.<a name="FNanchor_9_287" id="FNanchor_9_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_287" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In
graves at Hammam, a village on the Euphrates near
the mouth of the Sajûr, cylinder-seals were found which
exhibit unmistakable analogies to very early Babylonian
work;<a name="FNanchor_10_288" id="FNanchor_10_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_288" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the use of this form of seal at a period
anterior to the First Dynasty of Babylon is in itself
proof that Babylonian influence had reached the frontier
of Syria by the great trade-route up the course of the
Euphrates, along which the armies of Sargon of Akkad
had already marched in their raid to the Mediterranean
coast.<a name="FNanchor_11_289" id="FNanchor_11_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_289" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It is not improbable, too, that Carchemish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
herself sent her own products at this time to Babylon,
for one class of her local pottery at any rate appears to
have been valued by other races and to have formed an
article of export. At the time of the later kings of the
First Dynasty a special kind of large clay vessel, in use
in Northern Babylonia, was known as "a Carchemisian,"
and was evidently manufactured at Carchemish and
exported.<a name="FNanchor_12_290" id="FNanchor_12_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_290" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The trade was no doubt encouraged by the
close relations established under Hammurabi and his
successors with the West, but its existence points to the
possibility of still earlier commercial intercourse, such
as would explain the occurrence of archaic Babylonian
cylinder-seals in early graves in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>But, apart from such trade relations, there is nothing
to suggest that the early culture of Carchemish and its
adjacent districts had been effected to any great extent
by that of Babylon, nor is there any indication that the
inhabitants of the early city were Semites. Indeed,
the archæological evidence is entirely in favour of the
opposite view. The bronze age at Carchemish and its
neighbourhood is distinguished from the preceding
period by the use of metal, by different burial customs,
and by new types of pottery, and must be regarded as
marking the advent of a foreign people. But throughout
the bronze age itself at Carchemish, from its beginning
in the third millennium to its close in the eleventh
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, there is a uniform development.<a name="FNanchor_13_291" id="FNanchor_13_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_291" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> There
is no sudden outcrop of new types such as had marked
its own beginning, and, since in its later periods it was
essentially Hittite, we may assume that it was neither
inaugurated nor interrupted by the Semites. Its earlier
representatives, before the great Hittite migration from
Anatolia, may well have been a branch of that proto-Mitannian
stock, itself possibly of Anatolian origin,
evidence of whose presence we shall note at Ashur
before the rise of Babylon's First Dynasty.<a name="FNanchor_14_292" id="FNanchor_14_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_292" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Carchemish lies out of the direct road from Babylon
to Northern Syria, and it is remarkable that any trace
of early Babylonian influence should have been found
so far to the north as the mouth of the Sajûr. It is
farther down stream, after the Euphrates has turned
eastward towards its junction with the Khâbûr, that
we should expect to find evidence of a more striking
character; and it is precisely there, along the river
route from Syria to Akkad, that we have recovered
definite proof, at the time of the First Dynasty of
Babylon, of the existence of Amorite or West-Semitic
settlements with a culture that was Babylonian in its
essential features. The evidence is drawn mainly from
one district, the kingdom of Khana, which lay not far
from the mouth of the Khâbûr. One of the chief
towns, and probably the capital of the kingdom, was
Tirka, the site of which probably lay near Tell 'Ashar
or Tell 'Ishar, a place situated between Dêr ez-Zôr
and Sâlihîya and about four hours from the latter.
The identification is certain, since an Assyrian inscription
of the ninth century was found there, recording
the rebuilding of the local temple which is stated in the
text to have been "in Tirka."<a name="FNanchor_15_293" id="FNanchor_15_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_293" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> From about this region
three tablets have also been recovered, all dating from
the period of the First Dynasty of Babylon and throwing
considerable light on the character of West Semitic
culture in a district within the reach of Babylonian
influence.</p>

<p>One of these documents records a deed of gift by
which Isharlim, a king of Khana, conveys to one of his
subjects a house in a village within the district of Tirka.<a name="FNanchor_16_294" id="FNanchor_16_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_294" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
On a second document is inscribed a similar deed of gift
by which another king of the same district, Ammi-baïl,
the son of Shunu'-rammu, bestows two plots of land on
a certain Pagirum, described as "his servant," evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
in return for faithful service;<a name="FNanchor_17_295" id="FNanchor_17_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_295" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and, as one of the plots
was in Tirka, it is probable that the deed was drawn up
in that city. The third document is perhaps the most
interesting of the three, since it contains a marriage-contract
and is dated in the reign of a king who bears
the name of Hammurabih. This last ruler has by some
been confidently regarded as identical with Hammurabi
of the First Dynasty of Babylon, and it has been
assumed that it was drawn up at a time when Khana
had been conquered and annexed by that monarch, of
whose advance into that region we have independent
evidence.<a name="FNanchor_18_296" id="FNanchor_18_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_296" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But since the tablet appears to be the
latest of the three, it is clear that Khana had been subject
to Babylonian influence long before Hammurabi's
conquest. And, even if we regard Hammurabih as no
more than a local king of Khana, the document has
furnished us with a West-Semitic variant of Hammurabi's
name, or one that is closely parallel to it.</p>

<p>The remarkable fact about all these texts is that they
are drawn up in the style of legal documents of the
period of the First Dynasty of Babylon. But, while the
terminology is much the same, it has been adapted to
local conditions. The early Babylonian method of
dating by events<a name="FNanchor_19_297" id="FNanchor_19_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_297" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> has been taken over, but the formulas
are not those in use at this period in Babylonia, but
are peculiar to the kingdom of Khana. Thus the first
deed of gift is dated in the year when Isharlim, the king,
built the great gate of the palace in the city of Kash-dakh;
the second was drawn up in the year in which
Ammi-baïl, the king, ascended the throne in his father's
house; while the marriage-contract is dated in the year
that Hammurabih, the king, opened the canal Khabur-ibal-bugash
from the city of Zakku-Isharlim to the city
of Zakku-Igitlim.<a name="FNanchor_20_298" id="FNanchor_20_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_298" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The names of the months, too, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
not those of Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_21_299" id="FNanchor_21_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_299" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and we find evidence that local
laws and customs were in force. Each of the deeds of
gift, for example, provides that any infringement of the
rights bestowed by the king is to be punished by a
money-fine of ten manehs of silver, and in addition the
delinquent is to undergo the quaint but doubtless very
painful process of having his head tarred with hot tar.
From the list of witnesses we gather that the community
was already organized much on the lines of a
provincial district of Babylonia. For, though we find a
cultivator or farmer occupying an important position,
we meet also a superintendent of the merchants, another
of the bakers, a chief judge, a chief seer, and members
of the priesthood. It is interesting, too, to note that
the kings of Khana were still great landowners, to judge
from the fact that the lands conveyed in the deeds of
gift were surrounded on almost every side by palace-property.
At the same time the chief gods of Khana
are associated with the king in the oath-formulæ, since
the royal property was also regarded as the property of
the Ba'al, or divine "Lord" of the soil.</p>

<p>The two chief Baalim or "Lords" of Khana were
the Sun-god and the West-Semitic deity, Dagon. The
latter is constantly referred to in the documents under
the Babylonian form of his name, Dagan. He stood
beside Shamash on the royal seal and in the local oath-formulæ,
and is associated in the latter with Iturmer,
who may well have been the old local god of Tirka,
deposed after the invasion of the Semites. His temple
in Tirka, which we know survived until the ninth
century,<a name="FNanchor_22_300" id="FNanchor_22_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_300" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> was probably the chief shrine of the city, and
the great part he played in the national life is attested
by the constant occurrence of his title as a component
part of personal names.<a name="FNanchor_23_301" id="FNanchor_23_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_301" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Later evidence proves that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Dagon was peculiarly the god of Ashdod, and the
princely writer of two of the letters from Tell el-Amarna,
who bore the name Dagan-takala, must have
ruled some district of northern or central Canaan. The
Khana documents prove that already at the time of the
First Dynasty his cult was established on the Euphrates,
and, in view of this fact, the occurrence of two early
kings of the Babylonian Dynasty of Nîsin with the names
of Idin-Dagan and Ishme-Dagan is certainly significant.
We know, too, that the original home of Ishbi-Ura, the
founder of the Dynasty of Nîsin, was Mari, a city and
district on the middle Euphrates.<a name="FNanchor_24_302" id="FNanchor_24_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_302" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> We may conclude,
then, that the Dynasties of Nîsin and Babylon, and probably
that of Larsa, were products of the same great
racial movement, and that, more than a century before
Sumu-abum established his throne at Babylon, Western
Semites had descended the Euphrates and had penetrated
into the southern districts of the country.</p>

<p>The new-comers probably owed their speedy success
in Babylonia in great part to the fact that many of the
immigrant tribes had already acquired the elements of
Babylonian culture. During their previous residence
within the sphere of settled civilization they had adopted
a way of life and a social organization which differed
but little from that of the country into which they came.
That they should have immigrated at all in a south-easterly
direction, in preference to remaining within their
own borders, was doubtless due to racial pressure to
which they themselves had been subjected. Canaan
was still in a ferment of unrest in consequence of the
arrival of fresh nomad tribes within her settled districts,
and, while many were doubtless diverted southwards
towards the Egyptian border, others pressed northwards
into Syria, exerting an outward pressure in their advance.
That the West-Semitic invasion of Babylonia differed
so essentially from that of Egypt by the Hyksos is to be
explained by this fringe of civilized settlements and
petty kingdoms, which formed a check upon the nomad
hordes behind them and dominated such of them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
succeeded in breaking through. In Egypt the damage
wrought by the Semitic barbarians was remembered for
generations after their expulsion,<a name="FNanchor_25_303" id="FNanchor_25_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_303" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> whereas in Babylonia
the invaders succeeded in establishing a dynasty which
gave its permanent form to Babylonian civilization.</p>

<p>Nîsin, the city in which, as we have seen, we first
obtain an indication of the presence of West-Semitic
rulers, probably lay in Southern Babylonia, and we
may picture the earlier immigrants as descending the
course of the Euphrates until they found an opportunity
of establishing themselves in the Babylonian
plain. The Elamite conquest, which put an end to the
dynasty of Ur, and stripped Babylonia of her eastern
provinces,<a name="FNanchor_26_304" id="FNanchor_26_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_304" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> afforded Nîsin the opportunity of claiming
the hegemony. Ishbi-Ura, the founder of the new
dynasty of kings, established his own family upon the
throne for nearly a century, and we may probably
regard his success in bringing his city to the front as
due to the Semitic elements in Southern Babylonia,
recently reinforced by fresh accretions from the north-west.
The centralization of authority under the later
kings of Ur had led to abuses in the administration,
and to the revolt of the Elamite provinces; and when
an invading army appeared before the capital and
carried the king, whom his courtiers had deified, to
captivity in Elam,<a name="FNanchor_27_305" id="FNanchor_27_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_305" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Sumerian prestige received a blow
from which it never recovered.</p>

<p>Shortly after Ishbi-Ura had established himself in
Nîsin, we find another noble, who bore the Semitic name
Naplanum, following his example, and founding an
independent line of rulers in the neighbouring city of
Larsa. But, in spite of the Semitic names borne by
these two leaders and by the kings who succeeded them
in their respective cities, it is clear that no great change
took place in the character of the population. The
commercial and administrative documents of the Nîsin
period closely resemble those of the Dynasty of Ur, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
evidently reflect an unbroken sequence in the course of
the national life.<a name="FNanchor_28_306" id="FNanchor_28_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_306" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The great bulk of the southern
Babylonians were still Sumerian, and we may regard
the new dynasties both at Nîsin and Larsa as representing
a comparatively small racial aristocracy, which
by organizing the national forces in resistance to the
Elamites, had succeeded in imposing their own rule
upon the native population. At Nîsin the unbroken
succession of five rulers is evidence of a settled state of
affairs, and though Gimil-ilishu reigned for no more
than ten years, his son and grandson, as well as his
father, Ishbi-Ura, all had long reigns. At Larsa, too,
we find Emisu and Samum, who succeeded Naplanum,
the founder of the dynasty, each retaining the throne
for more than a generation. It is probable that the
Sumerians accepted their new rulers without question,
and that the latter attempted to introduce no startling
innovations into their system of administrative control.</p>

<p>Of the two contemporaneous dynasties in Southern
Babylonia, there is no doubt that Nîsin was the more
important. Not only have we the direct evidence of the
Nippur Kings' List that it was to Nîsin the hegemony
passed from Ur,<a name="FNanchor_29_307" id="FNanchor_29_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_307" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> but what votive texts and building-records
have been recovered prove that its rulers
extended their sway over other of the great cities of
Sumer and Akkad. A fragmentary text of Idin-Dagan,
the son and successor of Gimil-ilishu, found at
Abû Habba, proves that Sippar acknowledged his
authority,<a name="FNanchor_30_308" id="FNanchor_30_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_308" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and inscribed bricks of his own son Ishme-Dagan
have been found in the south at Ur.<a name="FNanchor_31_309" id="FNanchor_31_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_309" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In all their inscriptions, too, the kings of Nîsin lay
claim to the rule of Sumer and Akkad, while Ishme-Dagan
and his son Libit-Ishtar<a name="FNanchor_32_310" id="FNanchor_32_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_310" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> adopt further descriptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
titles implying beneficent activities on their part in
the cities of Nippur, Ur, Erech and Eridu. The
recently published inscriptions of Libit-Ishtar, which
were recovered during the American excavations at
Nippur, prove that in his reign the central city and
shrine of Babylonia were under Nîsin's active control.
But he was the last king in the direct line from Ishbi-Ura,
and it is probable that the break in the succession
may be connected with a temporary depression in the
fortunes of the city; for we shortly have evidence of an
increase in the power of Larsa, in consequence of which
the city of Ur acknowledged her suserainty in place of
that of Nîsin. At the time of Libit-Ishtar's death
Zabâia was reigning at Larsa, but after three years the
latter was succeeded by Gungunum, who not only bore
the titles of king of Larsa and of Ur, but laid claim to
the rule of Sumer and Akkad.</p>

<p>At any rate, one member of the old dynastic family
of Nîsin acknowledged these new claims. Enannatum,
Libit-Ishtar's brother, was at this time chief priest of
the Moon-temple in Ur, and on cones discovered at
Mukayyar he commemorates the rebuilding of the Sun-temple
at Larsa for the preservation of his own life and
that of Gungunum.<a name="FNanchor_33_311" id="FNanchor_33_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_311" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> It is possible that when Ur-Ninib
secured the throne of Nîsin, the surviving members of
Ishbi-Ura's family fled from the city to its rival, and
that Enannatum, one of the most powerful of their
number, and possibly the direct heir to his brother's
throne, was installed by Gungunum in the high-priestly
office at Ur. It would be tempting to connect Libit-Ishtar's
fall with a fresh incursion of West-Semitic
tribes, who, recking little of any racial connexion with
themselves on the part of the reigning family at Nîsin
may have attacked the city with some success until
defeated and driven off by Ur-Ninib. We now know
that Ur-Ninib conducted a successful campaign against
the Su tribes on the west of Babylonia,<a name="FNanchor_34_312" id="FNanchor_34_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_312" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and in support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of the suggestion it would be possible to cite the much
discussed date-formula upon a tablet in the British
Museum, which was drawn up in "the year in which
the Amurru drove out Libit-Ishtar."<a name="FNanchor_35_313" id="FNanchor_35_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_313" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> But since the
Libit-Ishtar of the formula has no title, it is also
possible to identify him with a provincial governor,
probably of Sippar, who bore the name of Libit-Ishtar,
and seems to be referred to on other documents
inscribed in the reign of Apil-Sin, the grandfather of
Hammurabi.<a name="FNanchor_36_314" id="FNanchor_36_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_314" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The date assigned to the invasion on the
second alternative would correspond to another period
of unrest at Nîsin, which followed the long reign of
Enlil-bani, so that on either alternative we may conjecture
that the city of Nîsin was affected for a time by
a new incursion of Amorites.</p>

<p>Whether the fall of Libit-Ishtar may be traced to
such a cause or not, we now know that it was during
the reigns of Ur-Ninib and Gungunum, at Nîsin and at
Larsa respectively, that a West-Semitic Dynasty was
established at Babylon. Northern Babylonia now fell
under the political control of the invaders, and it is
significant of the new direction of their advance that
the only conflict connected in later tradition with the
name of Sumu-abum, the founder of Babylon's independent
line of rulers, was not with either of the dominant
cities in Sumer, but with Assyria in the far north. On
a late chronicle it is recorded that Ilu-shûma, King
of Assyria, marched against Su-abu, or Sumu-abum,<a name="FNanchor_37_315" id="FNanchor_37_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_315" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and though the result of the encounter is not related,
we may assume that his motive in making the attack
was to check encroachments of the invaders towards
the north and drive them southward into Babylonia.
Ilu-shûma's own name is purely Semitic, and since the
Amorite god Dagan enters into the composition of
a name borne by more than one early Assyrian ruler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
we may assume that Assyria received her Semitic
population at about this period as another offshoot
of the Amorite migration.</p>

<p>This assumption does not rest entirely on evidence
supplied by the royal names, but finds indirect confirmation
in recent archæological research. The excavations
on the site of Ashur, the earliest Assyrian
capital, tend to show that the first settlements in that
country, of which we have recovered traces, were made
by a people closely akin to the Sumerians of Southern
Babylonia.<a name="FNanchor_38_316" id="FNanchor_38_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_316" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> It was in the
course of work upon a temple
dedicated to Ishtar, the
national goddess of Assyria,
that remains were found of
very early periods of occupation.
Below the foundation
of the later building a still
older temple was found, also
dedicated to that goddess.
Incidentally this building has
an interest of its own, for it
proved to be the earliest temple
yet discovered in Assyria,
dating, as it probably does,
from the close of the third
millennium <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Still deeper
excavation, below the level of
this primitive Assyrian shrine,
revealed a stratum in which
were several examples of rude
sculpture, apparently representing, not Semites, but the
early non-Semitic inhabitants of Southern Babylonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>The extremely archaic character of the work is
well illustrated by a head, possibly that of a female
figure,<a name="FNanchor_39_317" id="FNanchor_39_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_317" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> in which the inlaying of the eyes recalls a

the most striking evidence was furnished by heads of
male figures, which, if offered for sale without a knowledge
of their <i>provenance,</i> would undoubtedly have
been accepted as coming from Tello or Bismâya, the
sites of the early Sumerian cities of Lagash and Adab.
The racial type presented by the heads appears to be
purely Sumerian, and, though one figure at least is
bearded, the Sumerian practice of shaving the head
was evidently in vogue.<a name="FNanchor_40_318" id="FNanchor_40_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_318" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>In other limestone figures, of
which the bodies have been preserved, the treatment
of the garments corresponds precisely to that in archaic
Sumerian sculpture. The figures wear the same rough
woollen garments, and the conventionalized treatment
of the separate flocks of wool is identical in both sets of
examples.<a name="FNanchor_41_319" id="FNanchor_41_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_319" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The evidence is not yet fully published,
but, so far as it is available, it suggests that the
Sumerians, whose presence has hitherto been traced
only upon sites in Southern Babylonia, were also at a
very early period in occupation of Assyria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>The violent termination of their settlement at Ashur
is attested by an abundance of charred remains, which
separate the Sumerian stratum from that immediately
above it. Had we no evidence to the contrary, it
might have been assumed that their successors were of
the same stock as those early Semitic invaders who
dominated Northern Babylonia early in the third millennium
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and pushed eastward across the Tigris into
Gutium. But it is recognized that the founders of the
historic city of Ashur, records of whose achievements
have been recovered in the early building-inscriptions,
bear names which are quite un-Semitic in character.
There is a good deal to be said for regarding Ushpia, or
Aushpia, the traditional founder of the great temple of
the god Ashir,<a name="FNanchor_42_320" id="FNanchor_42_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_320" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and Kikia, the earliest builder of the
city's wall,<a name="FNanchor_43_321" id="FNanchor_43_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_321" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> as representing the first arrival of the
Mitannian race, which in the fourteenth century played,
under new leadership, so dominant a part in the politics
of Western Asia.<a name="FNanchor_44_322" id="FNanchor_44_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_322" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Not only have their names a Mitannian
sound, but we have undoubted evidence of the
worship of the Mitannian and Hittite god Teshub as
early as the period of the First Dynasty of Babylon;
and the fact that the Mitannian name, which incorporates
that of the deity, is borne by a witness on a
Babylonian contract, suggests that he came of a civilized
and settled race.<a name="FNanchor_45_323" id="FNanchor_45_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_323" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>It is true that the name Mitanni is not met with at
this period, but the geographical term Subartu is,<a name="FNanchor_46_324" id="FNanchor_46_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_324" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
in later tradition was regarded as having ranked with
Akkad, Elam and Amurru as one of the four quarters
of the ancient civilized world.</p>

<p>In the astrological and omen texts, which incorporate
very early traditions, the references to Shubartu are
interpreted as applying to Assyria,<a name="FNanchor_47_325" id="FNanchor_47_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_325" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but the term evidently
had an earlier connotation before the rise of
Assyria to power. It may well have included the
North-Mesopotamian region known afterwards as the
land of Mitanni, whose rulers are found in temporary
occupation of Nineveh, as their predecessors may have
established themselves at Ashur. But, however that
may be, it is clear that the historic city of Ashur was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
not in its origin either a Sumerian or a Semitic foundation.
Its later racial character must date from the
period of the Western Semites, whose amalgamation
with an alien and probably Anatolian strain, which they
found there, may account in part for the warlike and
brutal character of the Assyrians of history, so striking
a contrast to that of the milder and more commercial
Semites who settled in the lower Euphrates valley. As
in Babylonia, the language and to a great extent the
features of the Semite eventually predominated; and
the other element in the composition of the race
survived only in an increased ferocity of temperament.</p>

<p>This was the people of whose attack on Sumu-abum,
the founder of Babylon's greatness, later ages preserved
the tradition. No conflict with Assyria is commemorated
in Sumu-abum's date-formulæ, and it is possible
that it took place before he secured his throne in Babylon,
and built the great fortification-wall of the city with
which he inaugurated his reign. When once he was settled
there and had placed the town in a state of defence, he
began to extend his influence over neighbouring cities
in Akkad. Kibalbarru, which he fortified with a city-wall
in his third year, was probably in the immediate
neighbourhood of Babylon, and we know that Dilbat,
the fortification of which was completed in his ninth
year, lay only about seventeen miles south of the capital.<a name="FNanchor_48_326" id="FNanchor_48_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_326" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
The five years which separated these two efforts at
expansion were uneventful from the point of view of
political achievement, for the only noteworthy episodes
recorded were the building of a temple to the goddess
Nin-Sinna and another to Nannar, the Moon-god, in
which he afterwards set up a great cedar door. It may
be that the conflict with Assyria should be set in this
interval; but we should then have expected some sort of
reference to the successful repulse of the enemy, and it
is preferable to place it before his first year of rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>His success in the encounter with Assyria may well
have afforded this West-Semitic chieftain the opportunity
of fortifying one of the great towns of Akkad, and of
establishing himself there as its protector against the
danger of aggression from the north; and there is
no doubt that Babylon had long had some sort of local
governor, the traditions of whose office he inherited.
Since we have references to E-sagila in the time of the
Dynasties of Akkad and of Ur,<a name="FNanchor_49_327" id="FNanchor_49_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_327" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> the former rulers of
Babylon were probably no more than the chief priests
of Marduk's sanctuary. That Sumu-abum should have
changed the office to that of king, and that his successor
should have succeeded in establishing a dynasty that
endured for nearly three centuries, is evidence of the
unabated energy of the new settlers. Even the later
members of the dynasty retained their original West-Semitic
character,<a name="FNanchor_50_328" id="FNanchor_50_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_328" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and this fact, coupled with the
speedy control of other cities than Babylon, suggests
that the Western Semites had now arrived in far greater
numbers than during their earlier migration farther
down the Euphrates.</p>

<p>It is possible to trace the gradual growth of
Babylon's influence in Akkad under her new rulers,
and the stages by which she threw out her control over
an increasing area of territory. At Dilbat, for example,
she had no difficulties from the very first, and during
almost the whole period of the First Dynasty the
government of the city was scarcely distinguishable
from that of Babylon. The god Urash and the goddess
Lagamal were the patron deities of Dilbat, around
whose cult the life of the city centred; and there was
a local secular administration. But the latter was completely
subordinate to the capital, and no effort was
made, nor apparently was one required, to retain a
semblance of local independence. The treatment of
Sippar, on the other hand, was rather different. Here
Sumu-abum appears to have recognized the local ruler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
as his vassal; and, as a further concession to its semi-independent
state, he allowed the town the privilege of
continuing to use its own date-formulæ, derived from
local events.<a name="FNanchor_51_329" id="FNanchor_51_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_329" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Oaths, it is true, had to be taken in the
king of Babylon's name and in that of the great Sun-god
of Sippar; but the city could arrange and use its
own system of time-reckoning without reference to the
capital's affairs. Perhaps the most interesting example
of Babylon's early system of provincial government is
that presented by the city of Kish, for we can there
trace the gradual extension of her control from a limited
suzerainty to complete annexation.</p>

<p>Kish lay far nearer to Babylon than Dilbat,<a name="FNanchor_52_330" id="FNanchor_52_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_330" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> but it
had a more illustrious past to inspire it than the other
city. It had played a great part in the earlier history
of Sumer and Akkad, and at the time of the West-Semitic
occupation of Babylon it was still governed by
independent kings. We have recovered an inscription
of one such ruler, Ashduni-erim, who may well have
been Sumu-abum's contemporary, for the record reflects
a state of affairs such as would have been caused by a
hostile invasion and gradual conquest of the country.<a name="FNanchor_53_331" id="FNanchor_53_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_331" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Although Ashduni-erim lays claim only to the kingdom
of Kish, he speaks in grandiloquent terms of the invasion,
relating how the four quarters of the world revolted
against him. For eight years he fought against the
enemy, so that in the eighth year his army was
reduced to three hundred men. But the city-god
Zamama and Ishtar, his consort, then came to his
succour and brought him supplies of food. With this
encouragement he marched out for a whole day, and
then for forty days he placed the enemy's land under
contribution; and he closes his inscription rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
abruptly by recording that he rebuilt the wall of Kish.
The clay cone was probably a foundation-record, which
he buried within the structure of the city-wall.</p>

<p>Ashduni-erim does not refer to his enemy by name,
but it is to be noted that the hostile territory lay within
a day's march of Kish, a description that surely points
to Babylon. The eight years of conflict fit in admirably
with the suggestion, for we know that it was in Sumu-abum's
tenth year, exactly eight years after his occupation
of Kibalbarru, that his suzerainty was acknowledged
in Kish. Sumu-abum named that year of his reign after
his dedication of a crown to the god Anu of Kish,<a name="FNanchor_54_332" id="FNanchor_54_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_332" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and
we may conjecture that Ashduni-erim, weakened by the
long conflict which he describes, came to terms with his
stronger neighbour and accepted the position of a vassal.
Having given guarantees for his fidelity, he would have
received Sumu-abum in Kish, where the latter as the
suzerain of the city performed the dedication he commemorated
in his date-formula for that year. This
would fully explain the guarded terms in which
Ashduni-erim refers to the enemy in his inscription,
the rebuilding of the city-wall having, on this supposition,
been undertaken with Babylon's consent.<a name="FNanchor_55_333" id="FNanchor_55_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_333" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That Kish was accorded the position of a vassal
state is certain, for, among contract-tablets recovered
from the city, several were drawn up in the reign
of Mananâ, who was Sumu-abum's vassal. In these
documents the oath is taken in Mananâ's name, but
they are dated by the formula for Sumu-abum's
thirteenth year, commemorating his capture of Kazallu.
The importance of the latter event may be held to
explain the use of the suzerain's own formula, for other
documents in Mananâ's reign are dated by local events,
proving that at Kish, as at Sippar, a vassal city of
Babylon was allowed the privilege of retaining its own
system of time-reckoning. If we are right in regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Ashduni-erim as Sumu-abum's contemporary, it is clear
that he must have been succeeded by Mananâ within
three years of his capitulation to Babylon. During the
next few years the throne of Kish was occupied by
at least three rulers in quick succession, Sumu-ditana,
Iawium, and Khalium,<a name="FNanchor_56_334" id="FNanchor_56_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_334" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> for we know that by the
thirteenth year of Sumu-la-ilum, who succeeded Sumu-abum
on the throne of Babylon, the city of Kish had
revolted and had been finally annexed.</p>

<p>The conquest of Kazallu, winch Sumu-abum carried
out in the last year but one of his reign, was the most
important of Babylon's early victories, for it marked an
extension of her influence beyond the limits of Akkad.
The city appears to have lain to the east of the Tigris,
and the two most powerful empires in the past history
of Babylonia had each come into active conflict with it
during the early years of their existence. Its conquest by
Akkad was regarded in Babylonian tradition as the most
notable achievement of Sargon's reign; and at a later
period Dungi of Ur, after capturing the Elamite border
city of Dêr, had extended his empire to the north or
east by including Kazallu within its borders.<a name="FNanchor_57_335" id="FNanchor_57_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_335" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Sumu-abum's
conquest was probably little more than a successful
raid, for in the reign of Sumu-la-ilum Kazallu in
its turn attacked Babylon, and, by fully occupying her
energies, delayed her southward expansion for some
years.</p>

<p>In the earlier part of his reign Sumu-la-ilum appears
to have devoted himself to consolidating the position
his predecessor had secured and to improving the
internal resources of his kingdom. The Shamash-khegallum
Canal, which he cut immediately on his
accession, lay probably in the neighbourhood of Sippar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and later on he further improved the country's system
of irrigation by a second canal to which he gave his
own name.<a name="FNanchor_58_336" id="FNanchor_58_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_336" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The policy he thus inaugurated was energetically
maintained by his successors, and much of
Babylon's wealth and prosperity under her early kings
may be traced to the care they lavished on increasing
the area of land under cultivation. Sumu-la-ilum also
rebuilt the great fortification-wall of his capital, but
during his first twelve years he records only one military
expedition.<a name="FNanchor_59_337" id="FNanchor_59_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_337" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> It was in his thirteenth year that the
revolt and reconquest of Kish put an end to this period
of peaceful development.</p>

<p>The importance attached by Babylon to the suppression
of this revolt is attested by the fact that for five
years it formed an era for the dating of documents,
which was only discontinued when the city of Kazallu,
under the leadership of Iakhzir-ilum, administered a
fresh shock to the growing kingdom by an invasion of
Babylonian territory. Iakhzir-ilum appears to have
secured the co-operation of Kish by inciting it once
more to rebellion, for in the following year Babylon
destroyed the wall of Anu in that city; and, after re-establishing
her authority there, she devoted her next
campaign to carrying the war into the enemy's country.
That the subsequent conquest of Kazallu and the defeat
of its army failed to afford a fresh subject for a nascent
era in the chronology is to be explained by the incompleteness
of the victory; for Iakhzir-ilum escaped the
fate which overtook his city, and it was only after five
years of continued resistance that he was finally defeated
and slain.<a name="FNanchor_60_338" id="FNanchor_60_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_338" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>After disposing of this source of danger from beyond
the Tigris, Sumu-la-ilum continued his predecessor's
policy of annexation within the limits of Akkad. In
his twenty-seventh year he commemorates the destruction
and rebuilding of the wall of Cuthah, suggesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
that the city had up to that time maintained its independence
and now only yielded it to force of arms. It
is significant that in the same year he records that he
treated the wall of the god Zakar in a similar fashion,
for Dûr-Zakar was one of the defences of Nippur,<a name="FNanchor_61_339" id="FNanchor_61_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_339" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and
lay either within the city-area or in its immediate
neighbourhood. That year thus appears to mark
Babylon's first bid for the rule of Sumer as well as of
Akkad, for the possession of the central city was
regarded as carrying with it the right of suzerainty
over the whole country. It is noteworthy, too, that
this success appears to correspond to a period of great
unrest at Nîsin in Southern Babylonia.</p>

<p>During the preceding period of forty years the
southern cities had continued to rule within their home
territory without interference from Babylon. In spite
of Sumu-abum's increasing influence in Northern Babylonia,
Ur-Ninib of Nîsin had claimed the control of
Akkad in virtue of his possession of Nippur, though
his authority cannot have been recognized much farther
to the north. Like the earlier king of Nîsin, Ishme-Dagan,
he styled himself in addition Lord of Erech
and patron of Nippur, Ur and Eridu, and so did his
son Bûr-Sin II., who succeeded his father after the
latter's long reign of twenty-eight years. Of the group
of southern cities Larsa alone continued to boast a line
of independent rulers, the throne having passed from
Gungunum successively to Abi-sarê<a name="FNanchor_62_340" id="FNanchor_62_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_340" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and Sumu-ilum;
and in the latter's reign it would seem that Larsa for
a time even ousted Nîsin from the hegemony in Sinner.
For we have recovered at Tello the votive figure of a
dog, which a certain priest of Lagash named Abba-dugga
dedicated to a goddess on his behalf,<a name="FNanchor_63_341" id="FNanchor_63_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_341" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and in
the inscription he refers to Sumu-ilum as King of Ur,
proving that the city had passed from the control of
Nîsin to that of Larsa. The goddess, to whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
dedication was made, was Nin-Nîsin, "the Lady of
Nîsin," a fact suggestive of the further possibility that
Nîsin itself may have acknowledged Sumu-ilum for a
time. It may be noted that in the list of Nîsin kings
one name is missing after those of Itêr-pîsha and Ura-imitti,
who followed Bûr-Sin on the throne in quick
succession.<a name="FNanchor_64_342" id="FNanchor_64_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_342" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> According to later tradition Ura-imitti had
named his gardener, Enlil-bani, to succeed him,<a name="FNanchor_65_343" id="FNanchor_65_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_343" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and in
the list the missing ruler is recorded to have reigned in
Nîsin for six months before Enlil-bani's accession. It is
perhaps just possible that we should restore his name
as that of Sumu-ilum of Larsa,<a name="FNanchor_66_344" id="FNanchor_66_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_344" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> who may have taken
advantage of the internal troubles of Nîsin, not only
to annex Ur, but to place himself for a few months
upon the rival throne, until driven out by Enlil-bani.
However that may be, it is certain that Larsa profited
by the unrest at Nîsin, and we may perhaps also
connect with it Babylon's successful incursion in the
south.<a name="FNanchor_67_345" id="FNanchor_67_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_345" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>There is no doubt that Sumu-la-ilum was the real
founder of Babylon's greatness as a military power.
We have the testimony of his later descendant Samsu-iluna
to the strategic importance of the fortresses he
built to protect his country's extended frontier;<a name="FNanchor_68_346" id="FNanchor_68_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_346" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and,
though Dûr-Zakar of Nippur is the only one the position
of which can be approximately identified, we may
assume that the majority of these lay along the east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and the south sides of Akkad, where the greatest danger
of invasion was to be anticipated. It does not seem
that Nippur itself passed at this time under more than
a temporary control by Babylon, and we may assume
that, after his successful raid, Sumu-la-ilum was content
to remain within the limits of Akkad, which he
strengthened with his line of forts. In his later years
he occupied the city of Barzi, and conducted some
further military operations, details of which we have
not recovered; but those were the last efforts on
Babylon's part for more than a generation.</p>

<p>The pause in expansion gave Babylon the opportunity
of husbanding her resources, after the first effort
of conquest had been rendered permanent in its effect
by Sumu-la-ilum. His two immediate successors,
Zabum and Apil-Sin, occupied themselves with the
internal administration of their kingdom and confined
their military activities to keeping the frontier intact.
Zabum indeed records a successful attack on Kazallu,
no doubt necessitated by renewed aggression on that
city's part; but his other most notable achievements
were the fortification of Kâr-Shamash, and the construction
of a canal or reservoir.<a name="FNanchor_69_347" id="FNanchor_69_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_347" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Equally uneventful
was the reign of Apil-Sin, for though Dûr-muti, the
wall of which he rebuilt, may have been acquired as
the result of conquest, he too was mainly occupied with
the consolidation and improvement of the territory
already won. He strengthened the walls of Barzi and
Babylon, cut two canals,<a name="FNanchor_70_348" id="FNanchor_70_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_348" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and rebuilt some of the great
temples.<a name="FNanchor_71_349" id="FNanchor_71_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_349" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> As a result of her peaceful development
during this period the country was rendered capable
of a still greater struggle, which was to free Sumer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and Akkad from a foreign domination, and, by over-coming
the invader, was to place Babylon for a time
at the head of a more powerful and united empire than
had yet been seen on the banks of the Euphrates.</p>

<p>The country's new foe was her old rival Elam, who
more than once before had by successful invasion
affected the course of Babylonian affairs. But on this
occasion she did more than raid, harry, and return:
she annexed the city of Larsa, and by using it as a
centre of control, attempted to extend her influence
over the whole of Sumer and Akkad. It was at the
close of Apil-Sin's reign at Babylon that Kudur-Mabuk,
the ruler of Western Elam, known at this period as the
land of Emutbal, invaded Southern Babylonia and, after
deposing Sili-Adad<a name="FNanchor_72_350" id="FNanchor_72_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_350" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> of Larsa, installed his own son
Warad-Sin upon the throne. It is a testimony to the
greatness of this achievement, that Larsa had for
some time enjoyed over Nîsin the position of leading
city in Sumer. Nûr-Adad, the successor of Sumu-ilum,
had retained control of the neighbouring city of
Ur, and, though Enlil-bani of Nîsin had continued to
lay claim to be King of Sumer and Akkad, this proud
title was wrested from Zambia or his successor by Sin-idinnam,
Nur-Adad's son.<a name="FNanchor_73_351" id="FNanchor_73_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_351" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Sin-idinnam, indeed, on
bricks from Muḳayyar in the British Museum makes a
reference to the military achievements by which he
had won the position for his city. In the text his
object is to record the rebuilding of the Moon-god's
temple in Ur, but he relates that he carried out this
work after he had made the foundation of the throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of Larsa secure and had smitten the whole of his
enemies with the sword.<a name="FNanchor_74_352" id="FNanchor_74_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_352" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> It is probable that his three
successors on the throne, who reigned for less than ten
years between them, failed to maintain his level of
achievement, and that Sin-magir recovered the hegemony
for Nîsin.<a name="FNanchor_75_353" id="FNanchor_75_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_353" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> But Ur, no doubt, remained under
Larsa's administration, and it was no mean nor inferior
city that Kudur-Mabuk seized and occupied.</p>

<p>The Elamite had seen his opportunity in the continual
conflicts which were taking place between the
two rival cities of Sumer. In their contest for the
hegemony Larsa had proved herself successful for a time,
but she was still the weaker city and doubtless more
exposed to attack from across the Tigris. Hence her
selection by Kudur-Mabuk as a basis for his attempt on
the country as a whole. He himself retained his position
in Elam as the <i>Adda</i> of Emutbal; but he installed his
two sons, Warad-Sin and Rîm-Sin, successively upon
the throne of Larsa, and encouraged them to attack
Nîsin and to lay claim to the rule of Sumer and Akkad.
But the success which attended their efforts soon
brought Babylon upon the scene, and we have the
curious spectacle of a three-cornered contest, in which
Nîsin is at war with Elam, while Babylon is at war in
turn with both. That Sin-muballit, the son of Apil-Sin,
did not combine with Nîsin to expel the invader
from Babylonian soil, may have played at first into the
hands of the Elamites. But it is not to be forgotten
that the Western Semites of Babylon were still a conquering
aristocracy, and their sympathies were far from
being involved in the fate of any part of Sumer. Both
Elam and Babylon must have foreseen that the capture
of Nîsin would prove a decisive advantage to the victor,
and each was content to see her weakened in the hope
of ultimate success. When Rîm-Sin actually proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the victor in the long struggle, and Larsa under his
regis inherited the traditions as well as the material
resources of the Nîsin Dynasty, the three-cornered contest
was reduced to a duel between Babylon and a more
powerful Larsa. Then for a generation there ensued a
fierce struggle between the two invading races, Elam
and the Western Semites, for the possession of the
country; and the fact that Hammurabi, Sin-muballit's
son, should have emerged victorious, was a justification
in full of his father's policy of avoiding any alliance
with the south. The Western Semites proved themselves
in the end strong enough to overcome the conqueror
of Nîsin, and thereby they were left in undisputed
possession of the whole of Babylonia.</p>

<p>It is possible, with the help of the date-formulæ and
votive inscriptions of the period, to follow in outline the
main features of this remarkable struggle. At first
Kudur-Mabuk's footing in Sumer was confined to the
city of Larsa, though even then he laid claim to the
title <i>Adda</i> of Amurru, a reference to be explained
perhaps by the suggested Amorite origin of the Larsa
and Nîsin dynasties, and reflecting a claim to the
suzerainty of the land from which his northern foes at
any rate boasted their origin.<a name="FNanchor_76_354" id="FNanchor_76_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_354" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Warad-Sin, on ascending
the throne, assumed merely the title King of Larsa, but
we soon find him becoming the patron of Ur, and
building a great fortification-wall in that city.<a name="FNanchor_77_355" id="FNanchor_77_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_355" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> He
then extended his authority to the south and east,
Eridu, Lagash, and Girsu all falling before his arms
or submitting to his suzerainty.<a name="FNanchor_78_356" id="FNanchor_78_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_356" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> During this period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Babylon remained aloof in the north, and Sin-muballit
is occupied with cutting canals and fortifying cities,
some of which he perhaps occupied for the first time.<a name="FNanchor_79_357" id="FNanchor_79_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_357" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
It was only in his fourteenth year, after Warad-Sin had
been succeeded at Larsa by his brother Rîm-Sin, that
we have evidence of Babylon taking an active part in
opposing Elamite pretensions.</p>

<p>In that year Sin-muballit records that he slew the
army of Ur with the sword, and, since we know that Ur
was at this time a vassal-city of Larsa, it is clear that
the army referred to was one of those under Rîm-Sin's
command. Three years later he transferred his attention
from Larsa to Nîsin, then under the control of
Damiḳ-ilishu, the son and successor of Sin-magir. On
that occasion Sin-muballit commemorates his conquest
of Nîsin, but it must have been little more than a
victory in the field, for Damiḳ-ilishu lost neither his
city nor his independence. In the last year of his reign
we find Sin-muballit fighting on the other front, and
claiming to have slain the army of Larsa with the
sword. It is clear that in these last seven years of his
reign Babylon proved herself capable of cheeking any
encroachments to the north on the part of Larsa and
the Elamites, and, by a continuance of the policy of
fortifying her vassal-cities,<a name="FNanchor_80_358" id="FNanchor_80_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_358" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> she paved the way for a
more vigorous offensive on the part of Hammurabi,
Sin-muballit's son and successor. Meanwhile the unfortunate
city of Nîsin was between two fires, though
for a few years longer Damiḳ-ilishu succeeded in beating
off both his opponents.</p>

<p>The military successes of Hammurabi fall within
two clearly defined periods, the first during the five
years which followed his sixth year of rule at Babylon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and a second period, of ten years' duration, beginning
with the thirteenth of his reign. On his accession he
appears to have inaugurated the reforms in the internal
administration of the country, which culminated towards
the close of his life in the promulgation of his famous
Code of Laws; for he commemorated his second year
as that in which he established righteousness in the
land. The following years were uneventful, the most
important royal acts being the installation of the chief-priest
in Kashbaran,<a name="FNanchor_81_359" id="FNanchor_81_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_359" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> the building of a wall for the
Gagûm, or great Cloister of Sippar, and of a temple to
Nannar in Babylon. But with his seventh year we find
his first reference to a military campaign in a claim to
the capture of Erech and Nîsin. This temporary success
against Damik-ilishu of Nîsin was doubtless a menace
to the plans of Rîm-Sin at Larsa, and it would appear
that Kudur-Mabuk came to the assistance of his son
by threatening Babylon's eastern border. At any rate
Hammurabi records a conflict with the land of Emutbal
in his eighth year, and, though the attack appears to
have been successfully repulsed with a gain of territory
to Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_82_360" id="FNanchor_82_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_360" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> the diversion was successful. Rîm-Sin
took advantage of the respite thus secured to renew his
attack with increased vigour upon Nîsin, and in the
following year, the seventeenth of his own reign, the
famous city fell, and Larsa under her Elamite ruler
secured the hegemony in the whole of Central and
Southern Babylonia.</p>

<p>Rîm-Sin's victory must have been a severe blow to
Babylon, and it would seem that she made no attempt
at first to recover her position in the south, since
Hammurabi occupied himself with a raid on Malgûm<a name="FNanchor_83_361" id="FNanchor_83_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_361" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> in
the west and with the capture of the cities of Rabikum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and Shalibi. But these were the last successes during
his first military period, and for nineteen years afterwards
Babylon achieved nothing of a similar nature to
commemorate in her date-formulæ. For the most part
the years are named after the dedication of statues
and the building and enrichment of temples. One
canal was cut,<a name="FNanchor_84_362" id="FNanchor_84_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_362" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and the process of fortification went on,
Sippar especially being put in a thorough state of
defence.<a name="FNanchor_85_363" id="FNanchor_85_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_363" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> But the negative evidence supplied by the
formulæ for this period suggests that it was one in
which Babylon completely failed in any attempt she
may have made to hinder the growth of Larsa's power
in the south.</p>

<p>In addition to his capital, Rîm-Sin had inherited
from his brother the control of the southern group of
cities, Ur, Erech, Girsu and Lagash, all of which lay
to the east of Larsa and nearer to the coast; and it was
probably before his conquest of Nîsin that he took
Erech from Damiḳ-ilishu, who had been attacked there
by Hammurabi two years before. For in more than
one of his inscriptions Rîm-Sin refers to the time when
Anu, Enlil and Enki, the great gods, had given the
fair city of Erech into his hands.<a name="FNanchor_86_364" id="FNanchor_86_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_364" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> We also know
that he took Kisurra, rebuilt the wall of Zabilum, and
extended his authority over Kesh, whose goddess
Ninmakh, he relates, gave him the kingship over the
whole country.<a name="FNanchor_87_365" id="FNanchor_87_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_365" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The most notable result of his conquest
of Nîsin was the possession of Nippur, which
now passed to him and regularized his earlier claim
to the rule of Sumer and Akkad. Thereafter he describes
himself as the exalted Prince of Nippur, or as
the shepherd of the whole land of Nippur; and we
possess an interesting confirmation of his recognition
there in a clay cone inscribed with a dedication for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
prolongation of his life by a private citizen, a certain
Ninib-gamil.<a name="FNanchor_88_366" id="FNanchor_88_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_366" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>That Rîm-Sin's rule in Sumer was attended by great
prosperity throughout the country as a whole, is attested
by the numerous commercial documents which have
been recovered both at Nippur and Larsa and are dated
in the era of his capture of Nîsin. There is also
evidence that he devoted himself to improving the
system of irrigation and of transport by water. He
canalized a section in the lower course of the Euphrates,
and dug the Tigris to the sea, no doubt removing from
its main channel an accumulation of silt, which not only
hindered traffic but increased the danger of flood and
the growth of the swamp-area. He also cut the
Mashtabba Canal, and others at Nippur and on the
Khabilu river.<a name="FNanchor_89_367" id="FNanchor_89_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_367" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> It would seem that, in spite of his
Elamite extraction and the intimate relations he continued
to maintain with his father Kudur-Mabuk, he
completely identified himself with the country of his
adoption; for in the course of his long life he married
twice, and both his wives, to judge from their fathers'
names, were of Semitic descent.<a name="FNanchor_90_368" id="FNanchor_90_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_368" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>It was not until nearly a generation had passed, after
Rîm-Sin's capture of Nîsin, that Hammurabi made any
headway against the Elamite domination, which for so
long had arrested any increase in the power of Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_91_369" id="FNanchor_91_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_369" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
But his success, when it came, was complete and enduring.
In his thirtieth year he records that he defeated
the army of Elam, and in the next campaign he followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
up this victory by invading the land of Emutbal, inflicting
a final defeat on the Elamites, and capturing and
annexing Larsa. Rîm-Sin himself appears to have survived
for many years, and to have given further trouble
to Babylon in the reign of Hammurabi's son, Samsu-iluna.&mdash;And
the evidence seems to show that for a few
years at least he was accorded the position of vassal
ruler at Larsa.<a name="FNanchor_92_370" id="FNanchor_92_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_370" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> On this supposition Hammurabi, after
his conquest of Sumer, would have treated the old
capital in the same way that Sumu-abum treated Kish.<a name="FNanchor_93_371" id="FNanchor_93_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_371" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
But it would seem that after a time Larsa must have
been deprived of many of its privileges, including that
of continuing its own era of time-reckoning; and
Hammurabi's letters to Sin-idinnam, his local representative,
give no hint of any divided rule. We may perhaps
assume that Rîm-Sin's subsequent revolt was due to
resentment at this treatment, and that in Samsu-iluna's
reign he seized a favourable opportunity to make one
more bid for independent rule in Babylonia.</p>

<p>The defeat of Rîm-Sin, and the annexation of Sumer
to Babylon, freed Hammurabi for the task of extending
his empire on its other three sides. During these later
years he twice made successful raids in the Elamite
country of Tupliash or Ashnunnak, and on the west he
destroyed the walls of Mari and Malgûm, defeated the
armies of Turukkum, Kagmum and Subartu, and in his
thirty-ninth year he records that he destroyed all his
enemies that dwelt beside Subartu. It is probable
that he includes Assyria under the geographical term
Subartu, for both Ashur and Nineveh were subject to
his rule; and one of his letters proves that his occupation
of Assyria was of a permanent character, and that
his authority was maintained by garrisons of Babylonian
troops. Hammurabi tells us too, in the Prologue to
his Code of Laws, that he subjugated "the settlements
on the Euphrates," implying the conquest of such local
West-Semitic kingdoms as that of Khana.<a name="FNanchor_94_372" id="FNanchor_94_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_372" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> On the
west we may therefore regard the area of his military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
activities as extending to the borders of Syria. Up to
the close of his reign he continued to improve the
defences of his country, for he devoted his last two
years to rebuilding the great fortification of Kâr-Shamash
on the Tigris and the wall of Rabikum on the
Euphrates, and he once again strengthened the city-wall
of Sippar. His building-inscriptions also bear
witness to his increased activity in the reconstruction
of temples during his closing years.<a name="FNanchor_95_373" id="FNanchor_95_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_373" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>An estimate of the extent of Hammurabi's empire
may be formed from the very exhaustive record of his
activities which he himself drew up as the Prologue to
his Code. He there enumerates the great cities of his
kingdom and the benefits he has conferred upon each
one of them. The list of cities is not drawn up with
any administrative object, but from a purely religious
standpoint, a recital of his treatment of each city being
followed by a reference to what he has done for its
temple and its city-god. Hence the majority of the
cities are not arranged on a geographical basis, but in
accordance with their relative rank as centres of religious
cult. Nippur naturally heads the list, and its possession
at this time by Babylon had, as we shall see,<a name="FNanchor_96_374" id="FNanchor_96_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_374" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> far-reaching
effects upon the development of the mythology and
religious system of the country. Next in order comes
Eridu, in virtue of the great age and sanctity of its
local oracle. Babylon, as the capital, comes third, and
then the great centres of Moon-and Sun-worship, followed
by the other great cities and shrines of Sumer
and Akkad, the king characterizing the benefits he has
bestowed on each. The list includes some of his western
conquests and ends with Ashur and Nineveh.<a name="FNanchor_97_375" id="FNanchor_97_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_375" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
significant of the racial character of his dynasty that
Hammurabi should here ascribe his victories on the
middle Euphrates to "the strength of Dagan, his
creator," proving that, like his ancestors before him,
he continued to be proud of his West-Semitic descent.</p>

<p>In view of the closer relations which had now been
established between Babylonia and the West, it may be
interesting to recall that an echo from these troubled
times found its way into the early traditions of the
Hebrews, and has been preserved in the Book of
Genesis. It is there related<a name="FNanchor_98_376" id="FNanchor_98_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_376" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> that Amraphel king of
Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of
Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim or the "nations," acting
as members of a confederation, invaded Eastern Palestine
to subdue the revolted tribes of that district.
Chedorlaomer is represented as the head of the confederation,
and though we know of no Elamite ruler of
that name, we have seen that Elam at about this period
had exercised control over a great part of Southern and
Central Babylonia, and that its Babylonian capital was
the city of Larsa, with which the Ellasar of the Hebrew
tradition is certainly to be identified.<a name="FNanchor_99_377" id="FNanchor_99_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_377" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Moreover, Kudur-Mabuk,
the historical founder of the Elamite domination
in Babylonia, did lay claim to the title of <i>Adda</i> or
ruler of the Amorites.<a name="FNanchor_100_378" id="FNanchor_100_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_378" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Amraphel of Shinar may well
be Hammurabi of Babylon himself, though, so far from
acknowledging the suzerainty of the Elamites, he was
their principal antagonist and brought their domination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
to an end. Tidal is a purely Hittite name,<a name="FNanchor_101_379" id="FNanchor_101_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_379" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and it is
significant that the close of Hammurabi's powerful
dynasty was, as we shall see presently, hastened by an
invasion of Hittite tribes. Thus all the great nations
which are mentioned in this passage in Genesis were
actually on the stage of history at this time, and, though
we have as yet found no trace in secular sources of such
a confederation under the leadership of Elam, the
Hebrew record represents a state of affairs in Western
Asia which was not impossible during the earlier half
of Hammurabi's reign.<a name="FNanchor_102_380" id="FNanchor_102_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_380" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>While Sumu-la-ilum may have laid the foundations
of Babylon's military power, Hammurabi was the real
founder of her greatness. To his military achievements
he added a genius for administrative detail, and his
letters and despatches, which have been recovered, reveal
him as in active control of even subordinate officials
stationed in distant cities of his empire. That he should
have superintended matters of public importance is what
might be naturally expected; but we also see him investigating
quite trivial complaints and disputes among
the humbler classes of his subjects, and often sending
back a case for retrial or for further report. In fact,
Hammurabi's fame will always rest on his achievements
as a law-giver, and on the great legal code which he
drew up for use throughout his empire. It is true that
this elaborate system of laws, which deal in detail with
every class of the population from the noble to the
slave, was not the creative work of Hammurabi himself.
Like all other ancient legal codes it was governed strictly
by precedent, and where it did not incorporate earlier
collections of laws, it was based on careful consideration
of established custom. Hammurabi's great achievement
was the codification of this mass of legal enactments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and the rigid enforcement of the provisions of the
resulting code throughout the whole territory of Babylonia.
Its provisions reflect the king's own enthusiasm,
of which his letters give independent proof, in the cause
of the humbler and the more oppressed classes of his
subjects. Numerous legal and commercial documents
also attest the manner in which its provisions were carried
out, and we have evidence that the legislative system
so established remained in practical force during subsequent
periods. It may be well, then, to pause at the
age of Hammurabi, in order to ascertain the main
features of early Babylonian civilization, and to estimate
its influence on the country's later development.</p>

been found, but at Kara Kuzal, on the Mesopotamian side of the Euphrates
opposite Hammam, where the pottery is of the Amarna type, two cylinder-seals
of a later period and probably of local manufacture were recovered;
they are engraved in the style classified by Mr. Woolley as "the Syrian
Geometric" (<i>op. cit.,</i> p. 92). The find is also of interest as proving the

the oath-formula, and from another we know that he survived Sumu-ditana,
whom he probably succeeded on the throne; Khalium may probably be
placed after the other three vassal-rulers whose names have been recovered.
There appears to have been a local custom at Kish for each ruler to choose a
different god with whom to be associated in the oath-formulæ; thus, while
Zamama, the city-god of Kish, appears in those of Iawium's reign, his place is
taken by Nannar and Sin under Mananâ and Khalium respectively. For the
tablets and their dates, see Thureau-Dangin, "Rev. d'Assyr.," VIII., pp.

Larsa; there is no evidence to connect him with Nîsin. On the other hand,
the six months' rule of the unknown king at Nîsin falls in the twentieth year

Babylon's greater possessions, rebuilding on two occasions E-meslam, the
temple of Nergal, the city-god. He also enriched Babylon on the material

the temple E-kiku for the goddess Ishtar and another shrine for the Sun-god.</p></div>

"Annals of the Kings of Assyria," p. lxxiv. f. The name was probably of
West Semitic origin, though the form Rammânu, "the thunderer," has been
noted by Prof. Sayce on a cylinder-seal beside the goddess Ashratum (cf. "Zeits.
f. Assyr.," VI., p. 161), and she elsewhere appears as the spouse of the god
Amurru (cf. Meyer, "Geschichte," I., ii., p. 406). The Sumerian equivalent
of Adad is still uncertain; Hrozný suggests the reading Ishkur (cf. "Zeits.
f. Assyr.," XX., pp. 424 ff.), while Thureau-Dangin, Clay and others prefer
Immer, suggested in "Königsinschriften," p. 208. Meanwhile it is preferable
to employ the reading Adad, for periods at any rate after the West-Semitic

"Cun. Texts in the Brit. Mus.," XXI., pl. 31, No. 91144; and Thureau-Dangin,
"Königsinschriften," p. 214 f.). We should then have to assume
that, before completing his conquest of Sumer, he had already pushed up
and across the Euphrates and had captured large districts of Amurru. It is
possible that this was so, but it should be noted that both Khallabu and Bît-Karkara
are mentioned in the Prologue to Hammurabi's Code of Laws, not
with "the settlements on the Euphrates," but immediately after Lagash and

<h4>THE AGE OF HAMMURABI AND ITS INFLUENCE ON LATER PERIODS</h4>


<p>Of no other period in the history of Babylon have
we so intimate a knowledge as that of the West-Semitic
kings under whom the city first attained
the rank of capital. It was a time of strenuous growth,
in the course of which the long struggle with regard to
language and racial dominance was decided in favour
of the Semite. But the victory involved no break of
continuity, for all the essential elements of Sumerian
culture were preserved, the very length of the struggle
having proved the main factor in securing their survival.
There had been a gradual assimilation on both sides,
though naturally the Sumerian had the more to give,
and, in spite of his political disappearance, he continued
to exert an indirect influence. This he owed in the
main to the energy of the Western Semite, who completed
the task of transforming a dying culture, so that
in its new embodiment it could be accepted by men of
a newer race.</p>

<p>Hammurabi's age was one of transition, and we have
fortunately recovered a great body of contemporaneous
evidence on which to base an analysis of its social and
political structure. On the one hand the great Code of
Laws supplies us with the state's administrative ideal
and standard of justice.<a name="FNanchor_1_381" id="FNanchor_1_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_381" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> On the other we have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
letters of the kings themselves, and the commercial and
legal documents of the period,<a name="FNanchor_2_382" id="FNanchor_2_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_382" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to prove that the Code
was no dead letter but was accurately adjusted to the
conditions of the time. The possibility has long been
recognized of the existence of similar codes of early
Sumerian origin, and a copy of one of them, on a tablet
of the Hammurabi period, has recently been recovered.<a name="FNanchor_3_383" id="FNanchor_3_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_383" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But
the value of Hammurabi's Code rests not so much
in any claim to extensive originality, but rather on its
correspondence to contemporary needs. It thus forms
a first-rate witness on the subjects with which it deals,
and where it gives no information, the letters and contracts
of the period often enable us to supply the
deficiency.</p>

<p>For the purpose of legislation the Babylonian community
was divided into three main classes or grades of
society, which corresponded to well-defined strata in the
social system. The highest or upper class embraced
all the officers or ministers attached to the court, the
higher officials and servants of the state, and the owners
of considerable landed property. But wealth or position
did not constitute the sole qualification distinguishing
the members of the upper class from that immediately
below them. In fact, while the majority of its members
enjoyed these advantages, it was possible for a man to
forfeit them through his own fault or misfortune and
yet to retain his social standing and privileges. It would
seem therefore that the distinction was based on a racial
qualification, and that the upper class, or nobles, as we
may perhaps term them,<a name="FNanchor_4_384" id="FNanchor_4_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_384" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> were men of the predominant,
race, sprung from the West-Semitic or Amorite stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
which had given Babylon its first independent dynasty.
In course of time its racial purity would tend to become
diluted by intermarriage with the older inhabitants,
especially where these had thrown in their lot with the
invaders and had espoused their cause. It is even
possible that some of the latter had from the first
obtained recognition in its ranks in return for military
or political service. But, speaking broadly, we may
regard the highest class in the social order as representing
a racial aristocracy that had imposed itself.</p>

<p>The second class in the population comprised the
great body of free men who did not come within the
ranks of the nobles; in fact, they formed a middle class
between the aristocracy and the slaves. They bore a
title which in itself implied a state of inferiority,<a name="FNanchor_5_385" id="FNanchor_5_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_385" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and
though they were not necessarily poor and could possess
slaves and property, they did not share the privileges of
the upper class. It is probable that they represented
the subject race, derived in part from the old Sumerian
element in the population, in part from the Semitic strain
which had long been settled in Northern Babylonia and
by intercourse and intermarriage had lost much of its
racial purity and independence. The difference, which
divided and marked off from one another these two
great classes of free men in the population, is well illustrated
by the scale of payments as compensation for
injury which they were obliged to make or were entitled
to receive. Thus if a noble should be guilty of stealing
an ox, or other animal, or a boat, which was private or
temple property, he had to pay thirty times its value as
compensation; whereas, if the thief were a member of
the middle class the penalty was reduced to ten times
the price, and, should he have no property with which
to pay, he was put to death. The penalty for man-slaughter
was also less if the assailant was a man of the
middle class; he could obtain a divorce more cheaply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and he paid his doctor or surgeon a smaller fee for a
successful operation. On the other hand, these privileges
were counterbalanced by a corresponding diminution of
the value at which his life and limbs were assessed.</p>

<p>That a racial distinction underlay the difference in
social position and standing is suggested by the current
penalties for assault, in accordance with which a noble
could demand an exact retaliation for injuries from one
of his own class, whereas he merely paid a money compensation
to any man of the middle class he might have
injured. Thus if one noble happened to knock out
the eye or the tooth of another, his own eye or his own
tooth was knocked out in return, and if he broke the
limb of one of the members of his own class, he had his
corresponding limb broken; but, if he knocked out the
eye of a member of the middle class, or broke his limb,
he was fined one maneh of silver, and for knocking out
the tooth of such a man, he was fined one-third of a
maneh. Other regulations point to a similar cleavage
in the social strata, which can best be explained by a
difference in race. Thus if two members of the same
class quarrelled and one of them made a peculiarly improper
assault on the other, the assailant was only fined,
the fine being larger if the quarrel was between two
nobles. But if such an assault was made by a member
of the middle class upon a noble, the assailant was
punished by being publicly beaten in the presence of
the assembly, when he received sixty stripes from an
ox-hide scourge.</p>

<p>The third and lowest class in the community were
the slaves, who were owned by both the upper classes,
but were naturally more numerous in the households of
the nobles and on their estates. The slave was his
master's absolute property, and on the contract-tablets
he is often referred to as "a head," as though he were
merely an animal. He constantly changed hands, by
sale, bequest, or when temporarily pledged for a debt.
For bad offences he was liable to severe punishment,
such as cutting off the ear, which was the penalty for
denying his master, or for making an aggravated assault
upon a noble. But, on the whole, his lot was not a
particularly hard one, for he was a recognized member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of his master's household, and, as a valuable piece of
property, it was obviously to his owner's interest to
keep him healthy and in good condition. In fact, the
value of the slave is attested by the severity of the
penalties exacted for abducting a male or female slave
from the owner's house and removing one from the
city; for the death penalty was imposed in such a case,
as also on anyone harbouring and taking possession of
a runaway slave. On the other hand, a fixed reward
was paid by the owner to anyone by whom a runaway
was captured and brought back. Special legislation was
also devised with the object of rendering the theft of
slaves difficult and their detection easy. Thus, if a
brander put a mark upon a slave without the owner's
consent, he was liable to have his hands cut off; and, if
he could prove that he had done so through being
deceived by another man, that man was put to death.
There was a regular trade in slaves, and no doubt their
numbers were constantly increased by captives taken
in war.</p>

<p>Though the slaves, as a class, had few rights of their
own, there were regulations in accordance with which,
under certain circumstances, they could acquire them,
and even obtain their freedom. Thus it was possible
for an industrious slave, while still in his master's
service, to acquire property of his own, or a slave might
inherit wealth from relatives; and, in such circumstances,
he was able with his master's consent to purchase
his freedom. Again, if a slave were captured by
the enemy and taken to a foreign land and sold, and
were then brought back by his new owner to his own
country, he could claim his liberty without having to
pay compensation to either of his masters. Moreover,
a slave could acquire certain rights while still in slavery.
Thus, if the owner of a female slave had begotten
children by her, he could not use her as payment for a
debt; and, in the event of his having done so, he was
obliged to ransom her by paying the original amount of
the debt in money. It was also possible for a male
slave, whether owned by a noble or by a member of the
middle class, to marry a free woman, and if he did so
his children were free and did not become the property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of his master. His wife, too, if a free woman, retained
her marriage-portion on her husband's death, and
supposing the couple had acquired property during the
time they lived together as man and wife, the owner of
the slave could only claim half of such property, the
other half being retained by the free woman for her
own use and for that of her children. The mere fact
that such a union was possible suggests that there was
no very marked cleavage between the social status of
the better class of slaves and that of the humbler
members of the middle class.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the land, which formed the principal
source of the wealth of Babylonia,<a name="FNanchor_6_386" id="FNanchor_6_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_386" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was carried on
mainly by slave labour, under the control of the two
upper classes of the population. The land itself was
largely in the hands of the crown, the temples, and
the great nobles and merchants who were landed proprietors;
and, including that still in communal or
tribal possession,<a name="FNanchor_7_387" id="FNanchor_7_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_387" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a very large proportion was cultivated
on lease. The usual practice in hiring land
for cultivation was for the tenant to pay his rent in
kind, by assigning a certain proportion of the crop,
generally a third or a half, to the owner, who advanced
the seed-corn.<a name="FNanchor_8_388" id="FNanchor_8_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_388" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The tenant was bound to till the land
and raise a crop, and should he neglect to do so he had
to pay the owner what was reckoned as the average
rent of the land, and he had also to break up the land
and plough it before handing it back. Elaborate regulations
were in force to adjust the landowner's duties
and responsibilities on the one hand, and what was due
to him from his tenant on the other. As the rent of a
field was usually reckoned at harvest, and its amount
depended on the size of the crop, it would have been
unfair that damage to the crop from flood or storm
should have been made up by the tenant; such a loss
was shared equally by the owner of the field and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
farmer, though, if the latter had already paid his rent
at the time the damage occurred, he could not make a
claim for repayment. There is evidence that disputes
were frequent not only between farmers and landowners,
but also between farmers and shepherds, for the latter,
when attempting to find pasture for their flocks, often
allowed their sheep to feed off the farmers' fields in
spring. For such cases a scale of compensation was
fixed. If the damage was done in the early spring,
when the plants were still small, the farmer harvested
the crop and received a price in kind as compensation
from the shepherd. But if it occurred later in the year,
when the sheep had been brought in from the meadows
and turned on to the common land by the city-gate, the
damage was heavier; in such a case the shepherd had to
take over the crop and compensate the farmer heavily.</p>

<p>The king himself was a very large owner of cattle
and sheep, and he levied tribute on the flocks and herds
of his subjects. The owners were bound to bring the
young cattle and lambs, that were due from them, to the
central town of the district in which they dwelt, and
they were then collected and added to the royal flocks
and herds. If the owners attempted to hold back any
that were due as tribute, they were afterwards forced to
incur the extra expense and trouble of driving the beasts
to Babylon. The flocks and herds owned by the king
and the great temples were probably enormous, and
yielded a considerable revenue in themselves apart from
the tribute and taxes levied upon private owners.
Shepherds and herdsmen were placed in charge of them,
and they were divided into groups under head-men, who
arranged the districts in which the herds and flocks were
to be grazed. The king received regular reports from
his chief shepherds and herdsmen, and it was the duty
of the governors of the larger towns and districts of
Babylonia to make tours of inspection and see that due
care was taken of the royal flocks. The sheep-shearing
for all the flocks that were pastured near the capital took
place in Babylon, and the king used to send out summonses
to his chief shepherds to inform them of the day
when the shearing would take place.<a name="FNanchor_9_389" id="FNanchor_9_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_389" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Separate flocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
that were royal and priestly property, were sometimes
under the same chief officer, a fact that tends to show
that the king himself exercised a considerable measure
of control over the sacred revenues.</p>

</div>

<p>In the regulation of the pastoral and agricultural
life of the community, custom played a very important
part, and this was recognized and enforced by royal
authority. Carelessness in looking after cattle was
punished by fine, but the owner was not held responsible
for damage unless negligence could be proved on his
part. Thus a bull might go wild at any time and gore
a man, who would have no redress against its owner.
But if the beast was known to be vicious, and its owner
had not blunted its horns nor shut it up, he was obliged
to pay compensation for damage. On the other hand,
the owner of cattle or asses, who had hired them out,
could exact compensation for the loss or ill-treatment of
his beasts. These were framed on the principle that
the hirer was responsible only for damage or loss which;
he could reasonably have prevented. If, for example, a
lion killed a hired ox or ass in the open country, or if an
ox was killed by lightning, the loss fell upon the owner
and not on the man who had hired the beast. But if
the hirer killed the ox through carelessness or by
beating it unmercifully, or if the beast broke its leg
while in his charge, he had to restore to the owner
another ox in its place. For less serious damage to the
beast the hirer paid compensation on a fixed scale.<a name="FNanchor_10_390" id="FNanchor_10_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_390" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
It is clear that such regulations merely gave the royal
sanction to long-established custom.</p>

<p>Both for looking after their herds and for the cultivation
of their estates the landed proprietors depended
to a great extent upon hired herdsmen and farmers;
and any dishonesty on the part of the latter with regard
to cattle, provender, or seed-corn was severely punished.
A theft of provender, for example, had to be made good,
and the culprit ran the additional risk of having his hands
cut off. Heavy compensation was exacted from any
man, who, for his own profit, hired out oxen which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
been entrusted to his charge; while, if a farmer stole
the seed-corn supplied for the field he had hired, so that
he produced no crop to share with the owner, not only
had he to pay compensation but he was liable to be torn
in pieces by oxen in the field he should have cultivated.<a name="FNanchor_11_391" id="FNanchor_11_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_391" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
In the age of Hammurabi the heavier penalties were no
doubt largely traditional, having come down from a more
barbarous time when dishonesty could only be kept in
check by strong measures. Their retention among the
statutes doubtless acted as an effective deterrent, and a
severe sentence, if carried out occasionally in the case of
an aggravated offence, would have sufficed to maintain
respect for the regulations.</p>

<p>In the semi-tropical climate of Babylonia the canals
played a vitally important part for the successful prosecution
of agriculture, and it was to the royal interest to
see that their channels were kept in a proper state of
repair and cleaned out at regular intervals. There is
evidence that nearly every king of the First Dynasty of
Babylon cut new canals and extended the system of
irrigation and transport by water that he had inherited.
The rich silt carried down by the rivers was deposited
partly in the canals, especially in those sections nearer
the main stream, with the result that the bed of a canal
was constantly in process of being raised. Every year
it was necessary to dig this deposit out and pile it upon
the banks. Every year the banks rose higher and
higher, until a point was reached when the labour
involved in getting rid of the silt became greater than
that required for cutting a new channel. Hence sections
of a canal were constantly being recut alongside the old
channel, and it is probable that many of the canals, the
cutting of which is commemorated in the texts, were
really reconstructions of older streams, the beds of which
had become hopelessly silted up.</p>

<p>At the present day the traveller in certain parts of
Babylonia comes across the raised embankments of old
canals extending across the plain within a short distance
of each other, and their parallel course is to be explained
by the process of recutting, which was put off as long as
possible, but was at last necessitated by the growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
height of the banks. As the bed of a canal gradually
rose too, the high banks served the purpose of retaining
the stream, and these were often washed away by the
flood-water which came down from the hills in spring.
An interesting letter has been preserved, that was written
by Hammurabi's grandson, Abi-eshu', who describes a
sudden rise of this sort in the level of the Irnina Canal
so that it overflowed its banks.<a name="FNanchor_12_392" id="FNanchor_12_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_392" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> At the time the king
was building a palace in the city of Kâr-Irnina, which
was supplied by the Irnina Canal, and every year a
certain amount of work was put into the building. At
the time the letter was written little more than a third
of the year's work had been done, when the building-operations
were stopped by flood, the canal having
overflowed its banks so that the water rose right up to
the town-wall.</p>

<p>It was the duty of the local governors to see that
the canals were kept in good repair, and they had the
power of requisitioning labour from the inhabitants of
villages and the owners of land situated on or near the
banks. In return, the villagers had the right of fishing
in the waters of a canal along the section in their charge,
and any poaching by other villagers in their part of the
stream was strictly forbidden. On one occasion in the
reign of Samsu-iluna, Hammurabi's son, fishermen from
the village of Itabim went down in their boats to the
district of Shakanim, and caught fish there contrary to
local custom. So the inhabitants of Shakanim complained
to the king of this infringement of their rights,
and he sent a palace-official to the authorities of Sippar.
in the jurisdiction of which the villages in question lay,
with instructions to inquire into the matter and take
steps to prevent any poaching in the future. Fishing
by line and net was a regular industry, and the preservation
of rights in local waters was jealously guarded.</p>

<p>The larger canals were fed directly from the river,
especially along the Euphrates, whose banks were lower
than those of the swifter Tigris. But along the latter
river, and also along the banks of the canals, it will be
obvious that some means had to be employed to raise
the water for purposes of irrigation from the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
channel to the higher level of the land. Reference is made
in the Babylonian inscriptions to irrigation-machines,<a name="FNanchor_13_393" id="FNanchor_13_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_393" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
and, although their exact form and construction are
not described, they must have been very similar to
those employed at the present day. The most primitive
method of raising water, which is commoner
to-day in Egypt than in Mesopotamia, is the <i>shadduf,</i>
which is worked by hand. It consists of a beam supported
in the centre; and at one end a bucket is
suspended for raising the water, while at the other end
is fixed a counter-weight. Thus comparatively little
labour is required to raise the bucket when full. That
this contrivance was employed on the Tigris is proved
by an Assyrian bas-relief, found at Kuyunjik, with
representations of the <i>shadduf</i> in operation. Two of
them are being used, the one above the other, to raise
the water to successive levels. These were probably
the contrivances usually employed by the early Babylonians
for raising the water to the level of their fields,
and the fact that they were light and easily removed
must have made them tempting objects to the dishonest
former. A scale of compensation was therefore in force,
regulating the payments to be made to the owner by
a detected thief. From the fact that these varied,
according to the class and value of the machine he stole,
we may infer that other contrivances, of a heavier and
more permanent character, were also employed.</p>

<p>One of these must certainly have corresponded to a
very primitive arrangement that is in general use at the
present day in Mesopotamia, particularly along the Tigris,
where the banks are high and steep. A recess or cutting
with perpendicular sides is driven into the bank, and a
wooden spindle is supported on struts in a horizontal position
over the recess, which resembles a well with one side
opening on to the river. A rope running over the spindle
is fastened to a skin in which the water is raised from
the river, being drawn up by horses, donkeys, or cattle
harnessed to the other end of the rope. To empty the
skin by hand into the irrigation channel would, of course,
entail considerable time and labour, and, to avoid this
necessity, an ingenious contrivance is employed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
skin is sewn up, not in the form of a closed bag, but of
a bag ending in a long narrow funnel. While the skin is
being filled and drawn to the top, the funnel is kept
raised by a thin line running over a lower spindle and
fastened off to the main rope, so that both are pulled
up together by the beasts. The positions of the spindles
and the length of the ropes are so adjusted, that the end
of the funnel stops just above a wooden trough on the
bank below the struts, while the rest of the skin is
drawn up higher and shoots its water through the
funnel into the trough. The trough is usually made
from half the trunk of a date-palm, hollowed out, and
one end leads to the irrigation-channel on the bank.
To give the beasts a better purchase in pulling up the
weight of water, an inclined plane is cut in the ground,
sloping away from the machine, and up and down this
the beasts are driven, the skin filling and emptying itself
automatically. To increase the supply of water, two
skins are often employed side by side, each with its own
tackle and set of beasts, and, as one is drawn up full, the
other is let down empty. Thus a continuous flow of
water is secured, and not more than one man or boy is
required to keep each set of beasts moving. No more
effective or simpler method could be devised of raising
water to a considerable height, and there can be no
doubt that, at the period of the First Dynasty, cattle
were employed not only for ploughing, but for working
primitive irrigation-machines of this character.</p>

<p>On the Euphrates, where the river-banks are lower,
a simple form of water-wheel was probably in use then
as it is to-day, wherever there was sufficient current to
work one. And the advantage of this form of machine
is that, so long as it is in order, it can be unlocked at
will and kept working without supervision day and
night. The wheel is formed of stripped boughs and
branches nailed together, with spokes joining the outer
rims to a roughly hewn axle. Around the outer rim
are tied a series of rough earthenware cups or bottles,
and a few rude paddles are fixed to the wheel, projecting
beyond the rim. The wheel is then set up in place
near the bank of the river, its axle resting on pillars of
rough masonry. The current turns the wheel, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
bottles, dipping below the surface, are raised up full,
and empty their water into a wooden trough at the top.
The banks of the Euphrates are usually sloping, and
the water is conducted from the trough to the fields
along a small aqueduct or earthen embankment. Such
wheels to-day are usually set up where there is a slight
drop in the river-bed and the water runs swiftly over
shallows. In order to span the difference in level
between the fields and the summer height of the stream
the wheels are often huge contrivances, and their rough
construction causes them to creak and groan as they
turn with the current. In a convenient place in the
river several of these are sometimes set up side by side,
and their noise when at work can be heard at a great
distance.<a name="FNanchor_14_394" id="FNanchor_14_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_394" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It is not unlikely that the later Sumerians had
already evolved these primitive forms of irrigation-machine,
and that the Babylonians of the First Dynasty
merely inherited them and passed them on to their
successors. When once invented they were incapable
of very great improvement. In the one the skin must
always remain a skin; in the other the wheel must
always be lightly constructed of boughs, or the strength
of the current would not suffice to turn it. We have seen
reason to believe that, in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II.
at Babylon, the triple well in the north-west corner
may be best explained as having formed the water-supply
for a hydraulic machine, consisting of an endless
chain of buckets passing over a great wheel. Such is
a very common form of raising water in Babylonia at
the present day. It is true that in some of these
machines the wheel for the buckets is still geared by
means of rough wooden cogs to the long pole or winch,
turned by beasts, who move round in a circle. But it is
very unlikely that the early Babylonians had evolved
the principle of the cogged wheel, and it was probably
not till the period of the later Assyrian empire that
bronze was so plentiful that it could have been used
in sufficient quantity for buckets on an endless chain.
There seems reason to believe that Sennacherib himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
introduced an innovation when he employed metal in
the construction of the machines that supplied water to
his palace;<a name="FNanchor_15_395" id="FNanchor_15_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_395" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and we may infer that even in the Neo-Babylonian
period a contrivance of that sort was still
a royal luxury, and that the farmer continued to use
the more primitive machines, sanctioned by immemorial
usage, which he could make with his own hands.</p>

<p class="caption">The drawing is taken from seal-impressions on a tablet of the Kassite period.</p>

<p class="caption">(After Clay.)</p>
</div>

<p>The manner in which the agricultural implements
employed in early Babylonia have survived to the
present day is well illustrated by their form of plough,
which closely resembles that still in use in parts of
Syria. We have no representation of the plough of
the First Babylonian Dynasty, but this was doubtless
the same as that of the Kassite period, of which a very
interesting representation has recently been recovered.
On a tablet found at Nippur and dated in the fourth
year of Nazi-Maruttash, are several impressions of a
cylinder-seal engraved with a representation of three
men ploughing.<a name="FNanchor_16_396" id="FNanchor_16_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_396" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The plough is drawn by two humped
bulls, or zebu, who are being driven by one of the men,
while another holds the two handles of the plough and
guides it. The third man has a bag of seed-corn slung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
over his shoulders and is in the act of feeding seed with
his right hand into a tube or grain-drill, down which it
passed into the furrow made by the plough. At the
top of the tube is a bowl, with a hole in the bottom
opening on to the tube, which acted as a funnel and
enabled the sower to drop the seed in without scattering
it. This is the earliest representation of the Babylonian
plough that we possess, and its value is increased by
the fact that the plough is seen in operation. The
same seed-drill occurs in three later representations.
One of these also dates from the Kassite period, being
found upon a boundary-stone of the period of Meli-Shipak
II.,<a name="FNanchor_17_397" id="FNanchor_17_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_397" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> on which it is sculptured as the sacred symbol
of Geshtinna, the goddess of the plough.<a name="FNanchor_18_398" id="FNanchor_18_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_398" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The other
two are of the Assyrian period, one being represented
in enamelled brick on the walls of the palace at
Khorsabad,<a name="FNanchor_19_399" id="FNanchor_19_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_399" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the other being carved among the symbols
on the Black Stone of Esarhaddon, on which he gives
an account of his restoration of Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_20_400" id="FNanchor_20_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_400" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Similar
ploughs, with grain-drills of precisely the same structure,
are still used in Syria at the present time.<a name="FNanchor_21_401" id="FNanchor_21_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_401" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Before ploughing and sowing his land the Babylonian
farmer prepared it for irrigation by dividing it up into
a number of small squares or oblong patches, each
separated from the others by a low bank of earth.
Some of the banks, that ran lengthways through the
field, were made into small channels, the ends of which
were connected with his main irrigation-stream. No
gates nor sluices were employed, and, when he wished to
water one of his fields, he simply broke away the bank
opposite one of his small channels and let the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
flow into it. When it reached the part of his land he
wished to water, he blocked the channel with a little
earth and broke down its bank so that the water flowed
over one of the small squares and soaked it.</p>

<p class="caption">A MODERN GUFA.<br />

</div>

<p>He could then repeat the process with the next
square, and so on, afterwards returning to the main
channel and stopping the flow of water by blocking up
the hole he had made in the bank. Such is the present
process of irrigation in Mesopotamia, and there is no
doubt that it was adopted by the early Babylonians.
It was extremely simple, but needed care and vigilance,
especially when water was being carried into several
parts of an estate at once. Moreover, one main channel
often supplied the fields of several farmers, and, in
return for his share of the water, it was the duty of
each man to keep its banks, where it crossed his land, in
repair. If he failed to do so and the water forced a
breach and flooded his neighbour's field, he had to pay
compensation in kind for any crop that was ruined,
and, if he could not pay, his goods were sold, and his
neighbours, whose fields had been damaged, shared the
proceeds of the sale. Similarly, if a farmer left his
water running and forgot to shut it off, he had to pay
compensation for any damage it might do to a neighbouring
crop.</p>

<p>The date-palm formed the chief secondary source of
the country's wealth, for it grew luxuriantly in the
alluvium and supplied the Babylonians with one of
their principal articles of diet.<a name="FNanchor_22_402" id="FNanchor_22_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_402" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> From it, too, they
made a fermented wine, and a species of flour for
baking; its sap yielded palm-sugar, and its fibrous bark
was suitable for weaving ropes, while its trunk furnished
a light but tough building-material. The early Babylonian
kings encouraged the laying out of date-plantations
and the planting of gardens and orchards; and
special regulations were made with that object in view.
For a man could obtain a field for the purpose without
paying a yearly rent. He could plant and tend it for
four years, and in the fifth year of his tenancy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
original owner of the land took half the garden in payment,
while the planter kept the other half for himself.
Care was taken to see that the bargain was properly
carried out, for, if a bare patch had been left in the
plantation, it was reckoned in the planter's half; and
should the tenant neglect the trees during his first four
years of occupation, he was still liable to plant the
whole plot without receiving his half of it, and he had
to pay compensation in addition, which varied in
amount according to the original condition of the land.
In this way the authorities ensured that land should
not be taken over and allowed to deteriorate. For the
hire of a plantation the rent was fixed at two-thirds of
its produce, the tenant providing all labour and supplying
the necessary irrigation-water.</p>

<p class="caption">ASSYRIAN KELEK ON THE TIGRIS.<br />
(After Layard.)</p>
</div>


<p>From the royal letters of the period of the First
Dynasty we know that the canals were not only used
for irrigation, but also as water-ways for transport.&mdash;-The
letters contain directions for the bringing of corn, dates,
sesame-seed, and wood to Babylon, and we also know
that wool and oil were carried in bulk by water. For
transport of heavy goods on the Tigris and Euphrates
it is possible that rafts, floated on inflated skins, were
used from an early period, though the earliest evidence
we have of their employment is furnished by the bas-reliefs
from Nineveh. Such rafts have survived to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
present day,<a name="FNanchor_23_403" id="FNanchor_23_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_403" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and they are specially adapted for the
transport of heavy materials, for they are carried down
by the current, and are kept in the main stream by
means of huge sweeps or oars. Being formed only of
logs of wood and skins, they are not costly, for wood
was plentiful in the upper course of the rivers. At the
end of the journey, after the goods were landed, they
were broken up, the logs being sold at a profit, and the
skins, after being deflated, were packed on donkeys to
return up stream by caravan.<a name="FNanchor_24_404" id="FNanchor_24_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_404" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The use of such <i>keleks</i> can only have been general when through-river communication
was general, but, since we know that
Hammurabi included Assyria within his dominions, it
is not impossible that they may date from at least as
early a period as the First Dynasty. For purely local
traffic in small bulk the <i>gufa,</i> or light coracle, may
have been used in Babylonia at this time, for its representation
on the Assyrian monuments corresponds
exactly with its structure at the present time as used;
on the lower Tigris and Euphrates. The <i>gufa</i> is formed
of wicker-work coated with bitumen, but some of those
represented on the sculptures from Nineveh appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
have been covered with skins as in the description of
Herodotus.<a name="FNanchor_25_405" id="FNanchor_25_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_405" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In the texts and inscriptions of the early period
ships are referred to, and these were undoubtedly the
only class of vessels employed on the canals for conveying
supplies in bulk by water. The size of such
ships, or barges, was reckoned by the amount of grain
they were capable of carrying, measured by the <i>gur,</i>
the largest measure of capacity. We find vessels of
very different size referred to, varying from five to
seventy-five <i>gur</i> and over. The larger class probably
resembled the sailing barges and ferry-boats in use
to-day,<a name="FNanchor_26_406" id="FNanchor_26_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_406" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which are built of heavy timbers and have flat
bottoms when intended for the transport of beasts. In
Babylon at the time of the First Dynasty a boat-builder's
fee for constructing a vessel of sixty <i>gur</i> was
fixed at two shekels of silver, and it was proportionately
less for vessels of smaller capacity. A boat-builder was
held responsible for unsound work, and should defects
develop in a vessel within a year of its being launched,
he was obliged to strengthen or rebuild it at his own
expense. Boatmen and sailors formed a numerous
class in the community, and the yearly wage of a man
in such employment was fixed at sixty <i>gur</i> of corn.
Larger vessels carried crews under the command of a
captain, or chief boatman, and there is evidence that
the vessels owned by the king included many of the
larger type, which he employed for carrying grain, wool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and dates, as well as wood and stone for building-operations.</p>

</div>

<p>It is probable that there were regular officials, under
the king's control, who collected dues and looked after
the water-transport in the separate sections of the river,
or canal, on which they were stationed. It would have
been their duty to report any damage or defect in the
channel to the king, who would send orders to the
local governor that the necessary repairs should be put
in hand. One of Hammurabi's letters deals with the
blocking of a canal at Erech, about which he had
received such reports. The dredging already undertaken
had not been thoroughly done, so that the canal
had soon silted up again and boats were prevented
from reaching the city; in his letter Hammurabi sent
pressing orders that the canal was to be rendered
navigable within three days.<a name="FNanchor_27_407" id="FNanchor_27_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_407" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Special regulations were
also in force with regard to the respective responsibilities
of boat-owners, boatmen and their clients. If a boatman
hired a boat from its owner, he was held responsible
for it, and had to replace it should it be lost or sunk; but
if he refloated it, he had only to pay the owner half its
value for the damage it had sustained. Boatmen were
also responsible for the safety of goods, such as corn,
wool, oil or dates, which they had undertaken to carry
for hire, and they had to make good any total loss due
to their own carelessness. Collisions between two
vessels were also provided for, and should one of the
boats have been moored at the time, the boatman of
the other vessel had to pay compensation for the boat
that was sunk as well as for the lost cargo, the owner of
the latter estimating its value upon oath. Many cases
in the courts probably arose out of loss or damage to
goods in course of transport by water.</p>

<p>The commercial activities of Babylon at the time of
the First Dynasty led to a considerable growth in the
size of the larger cities, which ceased to be merely local
centres of distribution and began to engage in commerce
farther afield. Between Babylonia and Elam close
commercial relations had long been maintained, but
Hammurabi's western conquests opened up new markets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
to the merchants of his capital. The great trade-route
up the Euphrates and into Syria was no longer blocked
by military outposts and fortifications, placed there in
the vain attempt to keep back the invasion of Amorite
tribes; and the trade in pottery with Carchemish, of
which we have evidence under the later kings of the
First Dynasty,<a name="FNanchor_28_408" id="FNanchor_28_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_408" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> is significant of the new relations
established between Babylonia and the West. The
great merchants were, as a body, members of the upper
class, and while they themselves continued to reside in
Babylon, they employed traders who carried their goods
abroad for them by caravan.</p>

<p>Even Hammurabi could not entirely guarantee the
safety of such traders, for attacks by brigands were then
as common in the Nearer East as at the present day;
and there was always the additional risk that a caravan
might be captured by the enemy, if it ventured too near
a hostile frontier. In such circumstances the king saw
to it that the loss of the goods was not borne by the
agent, who had already risked his life and liberty in
undertaking their transport. For, if such an agent had
been forced in the course of his journey to give up some
of the goods he was carrying, he had to specify the
exact amount on oath on his return, and he was then
acquitted of all responsibility. But if it could be
proved before the elders of the city that he had
attempted to cheat his employer by misappropriating
money or goods to his own use, he was obliged to pay
the merchant three times the value of the goods he had
taken. The law was not one-sided and afforded the
agent equal protection in relation to his more powerful
employer; for should the latter be convicted of an
attempt to defraud his agent, by denying that the
due amount had been returned to him, he had to pay his
agent as compensation six times the amount in dispute.
The merchant always advanced the goods or money
with which to trade, and the fact that he could, if he
wished to do so, fix his own profit at double the value
of the capital, is an indication of the very satisfactory
returns obtained at this period from foreign commerce.
But the more usual practice was for merchant and trader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
to share the profits between them, and, in the event of
the latter making such bad bargains that there was a
loss on his journey, he had to refund to the merchant
the full value of the goods he had received. At the
time of the First Dynasty asses and donkeys were the
beasts of burden employed for carrying merchandise,
for the horse was as yet a great rarity and was not in
general use in Babylonia until after the Kassite
conquest.<a name="FNanchor_29_409" id="FNanchor_29_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_409" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>A large number of the First Dynasty contracts
relate to commercial journeys of this sort, and record
the terms of the bargains entered into between the
interested parties. Such partnerships were sometimes
concluded for a single journey, but more often for
longer periods of time. The merchant always demanded
a properly executed receipt for the money or goods he
advanced to the trader, and the latter received one for
any deposit or pledge he might have made in token of
his good faith. In reckoning their accounts on the
conclusion of a journey, only such amounts as were
specified in the receipts were regarded as legal obligations,
and, if either party had omitted to obtain his
proper documents, he did so at his own risk. The
market-places of the capital and the larger towns must
have been the centres where such business arrangements
were transacted, and official scribes were probably always
in attendance to draw up the terms of any bargain in the
presence of other merchants and traders, who acted as
witnesses. These had their names enumerated at the
close of the document, and since they were chosen from
local residents, some were always at hand to testify in
case of any subsequent dispute.</p>

<p>The town-life in Babylonia at this time must have
had many features in common with that of any provincial
town in Mesopotamia to-day, except that the
paternal government of the First Dynasty undoubtedly
saw to it that the streets were kept clean, and made
strenuous efforts to ensure that private houses should
be soundly built and maintained in proper repair. We
have already followed out the lines of some of the
streets in ancient Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_30_410" id="FNanchor_30_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_410" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and noted that, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
foundations of the houses were usually of burnt brick,
crude brick was invariably employed for their upper
structure. They were probably all buildings of a single
story, their flat mud roofs, supported on a layer of brush-wood
with poles for rafters, serving as a sleeping-place
for their inmates during the hot season. Contemporary
evidence goes to show that, before the period of
Hammurabi, private houses had not been very solidly
built, for his legislation contemplates the possibility of
their falling and injuring the inmates. In the case of
new houses the law fixed the responsibility upon the
builder, and we may infer that the very heavy penalties
exacted for bad work led to a marked improvement in
construction. For, when such a newly built house fell
and crushed the owner so that he died, the builder himself
was liable to be put to death. Should the fall of
the house kill the owner's son, the builder's own son was
slain; and, if one or more of the owner's slaves were
killed, the builder had to restore him slave for slave.
Any damage to the owner's possessions was also made
good by the builder, who had in addition to rebuild the
house at his own cost, or repair any portion of it that
had fallen. On the other hand, payment for sound work
was guaranteed, and the fact that the scale of payment
was fixed by the area of ground covered by the building,
is direct evidence that the houses of the period consisted
of no more than one story. The beginning of town-planning
on systematic lines, with streets running
through and crossing each other at right angles, of
which we have noted evidence at Babylon, may perhaps
date from the Hammurabi period; but no confident
opinion on the point can be expressed until further
excavation has been undertaken in the earlier strata of
the city.<a name="FNanchor_31_411" id="FNanchor_31_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_411" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>We have recovered from contemporary documents
a very full picture of family life in early Babylonia, for
the duties of the separate members of a family to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
another were regulated by law, and any change in
relationship was duly attested and recorded in legal
form before witnesses. Minute regulations were in force
with regard to marriage, divorce and the adoption and
maintenance of children, while the provision and disposal
of marriage-portions, the rights of widows and the
laws of inheritance were all controlled by the state upon
traditional lines. Perhaps the most striking feature in
the social system was the recognized status of the wife
in the Babylonian household, and the extremely independent
position enjoyed by women in general. Any
marriage to be legally binding had to be accompanied
by a duly executed and attested marriage-contract, and
without this necessary preliminary a woman was not
regarded as a wife in the legal sense. On the other
hand, when once such a marriage-contract had been
drawn up and attested, its inviolability was stringently
secured. Chastity on the wife's part was enforced
under severe penalty;<a name="FNanchor_32_412" id="FNanchor_32_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_412" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> but on the other hand the
husband's responsibility to maintain his wife in a position
suitable to their circumstances was also recognized.</p>

<p>The law gave the wife ample protection, and in the
case of the husband's desertion allowed her, under certain
conditions, to become the legal wife of another man.
If the husband wilfully deserted her and left his city
under no compulsion, she might remarry and he could
not reclaim her on his return. But if his desertion was
involuntary, as in the case of a man taken in battle and
carried off as a prisoner, this rule did not apply; and the
wife was allowed to shape her action during his absence
in accordance with the condition of her husband's affairs.
The regulations in such a case were extraordinarily in
favour of the woman. If the husband was possessed of
property sufficient to maintain the wife during the
period of his captivity, she had no excuse for remarriage;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
and, should she become the wife of another man, the
marriage was not regarded as legal and she was liable
to the extreme penalty for adultery. But if the husband
had not sufficient means for his wife's maintenance, it
was recognized that she would be thrown on her own
resources, and she was permitted to remarry. The returning
captive could claim his wife, but the children
of the second marriage remained with their own father.
The laws of divorce, too, safeguarded the woman's
interests, and only dealt with her severely if it could be
proved that she had wasted her household and failed in
her duty as a wife; in such a case she could be divorced
without compensation, and even reduced to the condition
of a slave in her husband's house. But, in the
absence of such proof, her maintenance was fully
secured; for the husband had to return her marriage-portion,
and, if there had been none, he must make her
an allowance. She also had the custody of her children,
for whose maintenance and education the husband had
to provide; and, at his death, the divorced wife and her
children could inherit a share of his estate.<a name="FNanchor_33_413" id="FNanchor_33_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_413" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The contraction
of a permanent disease by the wife was also
held to constitute no grounds for a divorce.</p>

<p>Such regulations throw an interesting light on the
position of the married woman in the Babylonian
community, which was not only unexampled in
antiquity but compares favourably, in point of freedom
and independence, with her status in many countries
of modern Europe. Still more remarkable were the
privileges capable of attainment by unmarried women
of the upper class, who in certain circumstances were
entitled to hold property in their own names and
engage in commercial undertakings. To secure such a
position a woman took vows, by which she became a
member of a class of votaries attached to one of the
chief temples in Babylon, Sippar, or another of the
great cities.<a name="FNanchor_34_414" id="FNanchor_34_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_414" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The duties of such women were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
sacerdotal, and, though they generally lived together,
in a special building, or convent, attached to the temple,
they enjoyed a position of great influence and independence
in the community. A votary could possess property
in her own name, and on taking her vows was
provided with a portion by her father, exactly as though
she were being given in marriage. This was vested in
herself, and did not become the property of her order,
nor of the temple to which she was attached; it was
devoted entirely to her maintenance, and after her
father's death, her brothers looked after her interest,
and she could farm the property out. Upon her death
her portion returned to her own family, unless her
father assigned her the privilege of bequeathing it;
but any property she inherited she could bequeath,
and she had not to pay taxes on it. She had considerable
freedom, could engage in commerce on her own
account, and, should she desire to do so, could leave,
the convent and contract a form of marriage.</p>

<p>While securing her these privileges, the vows she
took entailed corresponding responsibilities. Even when
married, a votary was still obliged to remain a virgin,
and, should her husband desire children, she could not
bear them herself, but must provide him with a maid or
concubine. But, in spite of this disability, she was
secured in her position as the permanent head of the
household. The concubine, though she might bear the
husband children, was always the wife's inferior, and
should she attempt to put herself on a level with the
votary, the latter could brand her and put her with the
female slaves; while in the event of the concubine
proving barren, she could be sold. Unmarried votaries,
too, could live in houses of their own and dispose of
their time and money in their own way. But a high
standard of commercial and social morality was expected
from them, and severe penalties were imposed for its
infringement. No votary, for example, was permitted
to open a beer-shop, and should she even enter one, she
ran the risk of being put to death. An unmarried
votary also enjoyed the status of a married woman, and
the penalty for slandering one was branding in the forehead.
That the social position enjoyed by a votary was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
considerable is proved by the fact that many women of
good family, and even members of the royal house, took
vows.</p>

<p>It is a striking fact that women of an Eastern race
should have achieved such a position of independence
at the beginning of the second millennium. The explanation
is perhaps to be sought in the great part
already played by commerce in Babylonian life. Among
contemporary races, occupied mainly by agriculture and
war, woman's activity was necessarily restricted to the
rearing of children and to the internal economy of the
household. But with the growth of Babylonian trade
and commercial enterprise, it would seem that the
demand arose, on the part of women of the upper class,
to take part in activities in which they considered
themselves capable of joining.<a name="FNanchor_35_415" id="FNanchor_35_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_415" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The success of the
experiment was doubtless due in part to the high
standard of morality exacted, and in part to the prestige
conferred by association with the religious cult.</p>

<p>The administration of justice at the period of the
First Dynasty was carried out by duly appointed
courts of law under the supervision of the king. The
judges were appointed by the crown, and a check was
put upon any arbitrary administration of the law by the
fact that the elders of the city sat with them and assisted
them in hearing and sifting evidence. When once a
judgment had been given and recorded, it was irrevocable,
and if any judge attempted to alter such a decision,
he was expelled from his judgment-seat and debarred
from exercising judicial functions in the future. The
regulation was probably intended to prevent the possibility
of subsequent bribery; and, if a litigant considered
that justice had not been done, it was always open to
him to appeal to the king. Hammurabi's letters prove
that he exercised strict supervision, not only over the
cases decided in the capital, but also over those which
were tried in the other great cities of Babylonia, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
is clear that he attempted to stamp out corruption on
the part of all those invested with authority. On one
occasion he had been informed of a case of bribery in
the town of Dûr-gurgurri, and he at once ordered the
governor of the district to investigate the charge and
send the guilty parties to Babylon for punishment. The
bribe, too, was to be confiscated and despatched to
Babylon under seal, a wise provision that would have
tended to discourage those inclined to tamper with the
course of justice, while at the same time it enriched the
state.<a name="FNanchor_36_416" id="FNanchor_36_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_416" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The king probably tried all cases of appeal in
person, when it was possible; but in distant cities he
deputed this duty to local officials. Many of the cases
that came before him arose from the extortions of
money-lenders,<a name="FNanchor_37_417" id="FNanchor_37_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_417" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and the king had no mercy when fraud
on their part was proved.</p>

<p>The relations maintained by the king with the
numerous classes of the priesthood was also very close,
and the control he exercised over the chief priests
and their subordinates appears to have been as effective
as that he maintained over the judicial authorities
throughout the country. Under the Sumerians there
had always been a tendency on the part of the
more powerful members of the hierarchy to usurp the
prerogatives of the crown,<a name="FNanchor_38_418" id="FNanchor_38_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_418" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but this danger appears
to have been fully discounted under the rule of the
Western Semites. One important section of the
priestly body were the astrologers, whose duty it probably
was to make periodical reports to the king on the
conjunctions and movements of the heavenly bodies,
with the object of ascertaining whether they portended
good or evil to the state. The later Assyrian practice
may well have had its origin at this period, and we may
conclude that the regulation of the calendar was carried
out in accordance with such advice. One of Hammurabi's
letters has come down to us in which he writes to
inform Sin-idinnam, his local governor of Larsa, that it
had been decided to insert an intercalary month in the
calendar. He writes that, as the year, that is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
calendar, had a deficiency, the month that was beginning
was to be registered as the second Elul; and he adds
the very practical reminder, that the insertion of the
extra month would not justify any postponement in the
payment of the regular tribute due from the city of
Larsa.<a name="FNanchor_39_419" id="FNanchor_39_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_419" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The lunar calendar of the Babylonians rendered
the periodical intercalation of months necessary, in order
that it should be made to correspond to the solar year;
and the duty of watching for the earliest appearance of
the new moon and fixing the first day of each month,
was among the most important of the functions performed
by the official astrologers.</p>

<p>In the naming of the year the priesthood must also
have played an important part, since the majority of the
events from which the years were named were of a
religious character. The system, which was inherited
from the Sumerians, cannot have been a very convenient
one,<a name="FNanchor_40_420" id="FNanchor_40_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_420" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and no doubt it owed its retention to the sanctity
of the religious rites and associations attaching to it.
There can be little doubt that, normally, the naming of
the year took place at the New Year's Feast, and, when
the event commemorated in the formula was the installation
of a chief priest or the dedication of temple-furniture,
the royal act, we may assume, was performed on
the day the year was named.<a name="FNanchor_41_421" id="FNanchor_41_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_421" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Often merely a provisional
title was adopted from the preceding formula,
and then perhaps no ceremony of naming was held, unless
in the course of it a great victory, or other important
occurrence, was commemorated by the renaming of the
year. The king must have consulted with his priestly
advisers before the close of the old year, and have settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
on the new formula in good time to allow of its
announcement in the outlying districts of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Another important religious class at this period was
the guild of soothsayers, and they also appear to have
been directly under the royal control. This we gather
from a letter of Ammi-ditana, one of the later kings of
the First Dynasty, written to three high officials of
Sippar, which illustrates the nature of their duties and
the sort of occasion on which they were called upon to
perform them.<a name="FNanchor_42_422" id="FNanchor_42_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_422" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It had come to the king's knowledge
that there was a scarcity of corn in Shagga, and since
that town was in the administrative district of Sippar, he
wrote to the officials concerned ordering them to send a
supply thither. But, before the corn was brought into
the city, they were to consult the soothsayers, in order
to ascertain whether the omens were favourable. The
method of inquiry is not specified, but it was probably
liver-divination, which was in common use during all
periods.<a name="FNanchor_43_423" id="FNanchor_43_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_423" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Only if the omens proved favourable, was the
corn to be brought into the town, and Ave may conclude
that the king took this precaution as he feared that the
scarcity of corn in Shagga was due to the anger of some
local deity. The astrologers would be able to ascertain
the facts, and, in the event of their reporting unfavourably,
no doubt the services of the local priesthood
would have been called in.</p>

<p>We have already seen that flocks and herds which
were owned by the great temples were sometimes pastured
with those of the king, and there is abundant
evidence that the king also superintended the collection
of temple-revenues along with his own. Collectors of
both secular and ecclesiastical tribute sent reports
directly to the king, and, if there was any deficit in the
supply expected from a collector, he had to make it
up himself. From one of Hammurabi's letters, for
example, we gather that two landowners, or money-lenders,
had lent money or advanced seed-corn to certain
farmers near the towns of Dûr-gurgurri and Rakhabu
and along the Tigris, and in settlement of their claims
had seized the crops, refusing to pay the proportion due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
to Bît-il-kittim, the great temple of the Sun-god at
Larsa. The governor of Larsa, the principal city in the
district, had rightly, as the representative of the palace,
caused the tax-collector to make up the deficiency, but
Hammurabi, on receiving the subordinate officer's complaint,
referred the matter back to the governor, and we
may infer from similar cases that the defaulting parties
had to make good the loss and submit to fines or punishment.<a name="FNanchor_44_424" id="FNanchor_44_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_424" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
The document throws an interesting light on
the methods of government administration, and the
manner in which the king gave personal supervision to
the smallest details.</p>

<p>It will be obvious that for the administration of the
country a large body of officials were required, and of
their number two classes, of a semi-military character,
enjoyed the king's special favour and protection. They
were placed in charge of public works and looked after
and controlled the public slaves, and they probably also
had a good deal to do with the collection of the revenue.
As payment for their duties, they were each granted
land with a house and garden; they were assigned sheep
and cattle to stock their land, and in addition they
Received a regular salary. They were, in a sense, personal
retainers of the king, and were liable to be sent
at any moment on a special mission. Disobedience was
severely punished, for if such an officer, when detailed
for special service, hired a substitute, he was liable to
be put to death and the substitute could take his office.
Sometimes an officer was sent to take charge of a distant
garrison for a long period, and when this was done his
home duties were performed by another man, who temporarily
occupied his house and land, and gave it back
to the officer on his return. If the officer had a son
old enough to perform the duty in his father's absence,
he war allowed to do so; and, if he was too young, his
maintenance was paid for out of the estate. Should
the officer fail to arrange, before his departure, for the
proper cultivation of his land and the discharge of his
local duties, another could take his place after the lapse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of a year, and on his return he could not reclaim his
land or office. When on garrison duty, or on special
service, he ran the risk of capture by the enemy, and in
that event his ransom was assured. For if his own
means did not suffice, the sum had to be paid from the
treasury of the local temple, and in the last resort by
the state. It was specially enacted that his land,
garden, and house were in no case to be sold to pay
for his ransom. They were inalienably attached to the
office he held, which appears to have been entailed in
the male line, since he was precluded from bequeathing
any of the property to his wife or daughter. They
could only pass from him and his male issue through
neglect or disobedience.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not improbable that the existence of this
specially favoured class of officer dates back to the
earliest settlement of the Western Semites in Babylonia.
The first of their number may well have been personal
retainers and followers of Sumu-abum, the founder of
the dynasty. Originally soldiers, they were probably
assigned lands throughout the country in return for
their services to the king, and they continued to serve
him by maintaining order and upholding his authority.
In the course of time specified duties were assigned to
them, but they retained their privileges, and they must
have remained a very valuable body of officers, on
whose personal loyalty the king could always rely.
In the case of war, they may have assisted in mobilization
for the army was probably raised on a territorial
basis, much on the lines of the <i>corvée</i> for public works
which was under their control.</p>

<p>By contemporary documents of the period much
light is thrown on other classes of the population, but,
as they were all connected with various departments in
the commercial or agricultural life of the community,
it will be unnecessary to describe them in further
detail. One class perhaps deserves mention, the surgeons,
since lack of professional skill was rather heavily
penalized. For if a surgeon, when called in by a noble,
carried out an operation so unskilfully as to cause his
death or inflict a permanent injury upon him, such as
the loss of an eye, the punishment was amputation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
both hands. No penalty appears to have been enacted
if the patient were a member of the middle class, but
should the slave of such a man die as the result of an
operation, the surgeon had to give the owner another
slave; and, in the event of the slave losing his eye, he
had to pay the owner half the slave's value. There
was, of course, no secular class in the population which
corresponded to the modern doctor, for the medicinal
use of herbs and drugs was not separated from their
employment in magic. Disease was looked upon as
due to the agency of evil spirits, or of those that controlled
them, and though many potions were doubtless
drunk of a curative nature, they were taken at the
instance of the magician, not of the doctor, and to the
accompaniment of magical rites and incantations.<a name="FNanchor_45_425" id="FNanchor_45_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_425" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In the religious sphere, the rise of Babylon to the
position of capital led to a number of important
changes, and to a revision of the Babylonian pantheon.
Marduk, the god of Babylon, from being a comparatively
obscure city-god, underwent a transformation in
proportion to the increase in his city's importance.
The achievements and attributes of Enlil, the chief
Sumerian deity, were ascribed to him, and the old
Sumerian sagas and legends, particularly those of the
creation of the world, were rewritten in this new spirit
by the Babylonian priesthood. The beginning of the
process may be accurately dated to the year of Hammurabi's
conquest of Rîm-Sin and his subsequent control
of Nippur, the ancient centre of the old Sumerian
faith. It does not appear that the earlier Semites,
when they conquered that city, had ever attempted
to modify the old traditions they found there, or to
appropriate them for their local gods. But a new
spirit was introduced with the triumph of the Western
Semites. The Sumerians were then a dying race, and
the gradual disappearance of their language as a living
tongue was accompanied by a systematic translation,
and a partial transformation, of their sacred literature.
Enlil could not be entirely ousted from the position he
had so long enjoyed, but Marduk became his greater
son. The younger god is represented as winning his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
position by his own valour, in coming to the help of
the older gods when their very existence was threatened
by the dragons of chaos; and, having slain the monster
of the deep, he is portrayed as creating the universe
from her severed body.<a name="FNanchor_46_426" id="FNanchor_46_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_426" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The older legends, no doubt,
continued to be treasured in the ancient cult-centres
of the land, but the Babylonian versions, under royal
sanction and encouragement, tended to gain wide
recognition and popularity.</p>

<p>Under the later kings of the First Dynasty a great
impetus was also given to all branches of literary activity.
The old Sumerian language still bulked largely in the
phraseology of legal and commercial documents, as well
as in the purely religious literature of the country.
And, to aid them in their study of the ancient texts,
the Semitic scribes undertook a systematic compilation
of explanatory lists of words and ideograms&mdash;the earliest
form of dictionary,&mdash;which continued in use into the
Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods. The Sumerian
texts, too, were copied out and furnished with inter-linear
Semitic translations. The astronomical and astrological
studies and records of the Sumerian priests were
taken over, and great collections were compiled in
combination with the early Akkadian records that had
come down to them. A study of the Babylonian literature
affords striking proof that the semitizing of the
country led to no break, nor set-back, in Babylonian
culture. The older texts and traditions were taken
over in bulk, and, except where the rank or position
of Marduk was affected, little change or modification
was made. The Semitic scribes no doubt developed
their inheritance, but expansion took place on the old
lines.</p>

<p>In commercial life, too, Sumerian customs remained
to a great extent unaltered. Taxes, rent, and prices
continued to be paid in kind, and though the talent,
maneh, and shekel were in use as metal weights, and;
silver was in partial circulation, no true currency was
developed. In the sale of land, for example, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
during the period of the Kassite kings, the purchase-price
was settled in shekel-weights of silver, but very
little metal actually changed hands. Various items
were exchanged against the land, and these, in addition
I to corn, the principal medium of exchange, included
slaves, animals, weapons, garments, etc., the value of
each item being reckoned on the same silver basis, until
the agreed purchase-price was made up. The early
Semitic Babylonian, despite his commercial activity, did
not advance beyond the transition stage between pure
barter and a regular currency.</p>

<p>One important advantage conferred by the Western
Semite on the country of his adoption was an increase
in the area of its commercial relations and a political
expansion to the north and west. He systematized its
laws, and placed its internal administration on a wider&mdash;and
more uniform basis. But the greatest and most
far-reaching change of the Hammurabi period was that
the common speech of the whole of Babylonia became
Semitic, as did the dominant racial element in the
population. And it was thanks to this fact that all
subsequent invasions of the country failed to alter the
main features in her civilization. Such alien strains
were absorbed in process of time, and, though they
undoubtedly introduced fresh blends into the racial
mixture, the Semitic element triumphed, and continued
to receive reinforcements from the parent stock. The
Sumerian race and language appear to have survived
longest in the extreme south of the country, and we
shall see that the rise of the Sea-Country kings may
perhaps be regarded as their last effective effort in the
political sphere.</p>

the first six days of the year, which suggest that this was the practice; even
the completion of the cutting of a canal might have been foreseen. Very
rarely, a formula may have been framed from an important event of
the preceding year, perhaps occurring towards its close; the defeat of Nîsin
in Sin-muballit's seventeenth date-formula is an instance in point, since one
document which bears the formula is dated on the sixth of Nisan. But there
is little to be said for Poebel's theory (cf. "Babylonian Legal and Business

usual practice. For editions of the First Dynasty date-formulæ, see "Letters

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h5>


<h4>THE CLOSE OF THE FIRST DYNASTY OF BABYLON AND
THE KINGS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE SEA</h4>


<p>In the closing years of Hammurabi's reign Babylon
had reached the climax of her early power. The
proud phraseology of the Prologue to his Code
conveys the impression that the empire was solidly
compact, and its component cities the willing recipients
of his royal clemency and favour. And there can be
no doubt that he owed his success in great measure to
the efficient administration he had established under his
personal control. His son, Samsu-iluna, inherited his
father's traditions, and in his letters that have survived
we have abundant evidence that he exercised the same
close supervision over the judicial and administrative
officers stationed in cities distant from the capital.
And it would appear that the first eight years of his
reign passed under the same peaceful conditions, that
had prevailed at the time of his accession to the throne.
He cut two canals, and the names he gave them commemorate
the wealth and abundance he hoped by their
means to bestow upon the people. It was in his third
and fourth years that the Samsu-iluna-nagab-nukhush-nishi
and the Samsu-iluna-khegallum Canals were
completed, and the royal activities were then confined
to the further adornment of the great temples of
Babylon and Sippar. His ninth year marks the crisis,
not only in Samsu-iluna's own reign, but in the early
fortunes of the kingdom. It is then that we first hear
of Kassite tribes appearing in force upon Babylon's
eastern frontier, and, though Samsu-iluna doubtless
defeated them, as he claims to have done, it is clear
that their emergence from the foothills of Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Elam, followed speedily by their penetration of Babylonian
territory, was the signal for setting the empire
in a blaze.</p>

<p>They must have met with some success before their
onslaught was arrested by the army sent against them,<a name="FNanchor_1_427" id="FNanchor_1_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_427" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and the renewal of hostilities in any form must have
aroused once more the fighting instinct of the Elamite
border tribes, which had been temporarily laid to rest by
Hammurabi's victories. Hammurabi's old antagonist,
Rîm-Sin himself, had long been living in comparative
retirement, and, in spite of his advanced age, the news
fired him to fresh efforts. His name was still on the
lips of those who had fought under him, and since the
death of his conqueror, Hammurabi, his prestige must
have tended to increase. When, therefore, his native
land of Emutbal, allying itself with the neighbouring
Elamite district of Idamaraz, followed up the Kassite
onslaught by an organized invasion, Rîm-Sin raised a
revolt in Southern Babylonia, and succeeded in gaining
possession of Erech and Nîsin. It would appear that
the Babylonian garrison in Larsa, too, was overcome,
and that the city passed once more under the independent
control of its old ruler.</p>

<p>With the whole south of the country in arms against
him, we may conjecture that Samsu-iluna detailed sufficient
forces to contain Rîm-Sin, while he dealt with the
invasion of Babylon's home-territory. He had little
difficulty in disposing of the Elamites, and, marching
southwards, he defeated Rîm-Sin's forces and reoccupied
Larsa.<a name="FNanchor_2_428" id="FNanchor_2_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_428" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It may be that it was at this time he
captured, or burnt, Rîm-Sin alive,<a name="FNanchor_3_429" id="FNanchor_3_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_429" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and that the palace
where this took place was the rebel leader's old palace
at Larsa, which he had been making his headquarters.
But the revolt was not completely subdued. Ur and
Erech still held out, and it was only after a further
campaign that Samsu-iluna recaptured them and razed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
their walls. He had thus succeeded in crushing the
first series of organized attacks upon the empire, but
the effort of dealing simultaneously with invasion and
internal revolt had evidently strained the national
resources. Garrisons had probably been reduced in
distant provinces, others had been cut down in order
to reinforce his armies in the field, and it is not surprising
that in his twelfth year these outlying districts
should have followed the prevailing lead. In that year
it is recorded that all the lands revolted against him.<a name="FNanchor_4_430" id="FNanchor_4_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_430" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We may with some confidence trace the main
source of Samsu-iluna's fresh troubles to the action
of Iluma-ilum, who, probably at this time, headed a revolt
in the Sea-Country on the shore of the Persian Gulf,
and declared his independence of Babylon. Samsu-iluna's
answer was to raise further levies and lead them
against his new foe. The subsequent battle was fiercely
contested on the very shore of the Gulf, for a later
chronicler records that the bodies of the slain were
carried off by the sea; yet it was either indecisive, or
resulted in the discomfiture of the Babylonians. We
may conjecture that the king was prevented from
employing his full forces to stamp out the rebellion, in
consequence of trouble in other quarters. For in the
following two years we find him destroying the cities
Kisurra and Sabum, and defeating the leader of a
rebellion in the home-territory of Babylon itself.<a name="FNanchor_5_431" id="FNanchor_5_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_431" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Iluma-ilum was thus afforded the opportunity of consolidating
his position, and we may perhaps see evidence
of his growing influence in Southern Babylonia in the
fact that at Tell Ṣifr not a single document has been
found dated in a later year of Samsu-iluna's reign than
the tenth.<a name="FNanchor_6_432" id="FNanchor_6_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_432" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In view of the fact that the central city of
Nippur eventually passed under Iluma-ilum's control, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
may probably assume that he was already encroaching
northwards, and that territory in the south of Sumer,
perhaps including the city of Larsa, passed now into his
possession. In support of this suggestion it may be
noted that, when Samsu-iluna, after suppressing the
Akkadian usurper, began repairing the damage wrought
in six years of continuous fighting, it is at Nîsin and at
Sippar that he rebuilds the ruined walls, and in Emutbal
that he repairs the great garrison-fortresses. Nîsin may
well have marked the most southerly limit of Babylon's
control, and we may picture the gradual expansion of
the Sea-Country, as the power of Babylon declined. The
"rebellious land," which Samsu-iluna boasts that he
overthrew in his twentieth year, was perhaps the Sea-Country,
for we know that he conducted a second
campaign against Iluma-ilum, who this time secured a
victory. If the Babylonian army succeeded in retreating
in comparatively good order, it would have formed a
sufficient justification for Samsu-iluna's boast that he
had given the rebellious land a lesson.</p>

<p>The fringe of territory in the extreme south-east of
Babylonia always exhibited a tendency to detach itself
from the upper riverain districts of Babylonia proper.
Forming the littoral of the Persian Gulf, and encroaching
in its northern area upon Elam, it consisted of great
stretches of rich alluvial soil interspersed with areas
of marsh-land and swamps, which tended to increase
where the rivers approached the coast. The swamps
undoubtedly acted as a protection to the country, for
while tracks and fords were known to the inhabitants,
a stranger from the north-west would in many places
have been completely baffled by them. The natives,
too, in their light reed-boats could escape from one
district to another, pushing along known passages and
eluding their pursuers, when once the tall reeds had
closed behind them. The later Assyrians at the height
of their power succeeded in subduing a series of revolts
in the Sea-Country, but it was only by enlisting the
help of native guides and by commandeering the light
canoes of neighbouring villages. The earlier kings
of Babylonia had always been content to leave the
swamp-dwellers to themselves, and at most to exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
a nominal recognition of suzerainty. But it is probable
that fresh energy had been lately introduced into the
district, and of this Iluma-ilum doubtless took advantage
when he succeeded, not only in leading a revolt, but in
establishing an independent kingdom.</p>

<p class="caption">(After a bas-relief at Nineveh.)</p>
</div>

<p>It is clear that the pressure exerted upon Babylonia
by the West-Semitic migration must have tended to
displace sections of the existing population. The
direction of advance was always down-stream, and the
pressure continued in force even after the occupation of
the country. Those strains in the population, which
differed most radically from the invaders, would be the
more likely to seek sanctuary elsewhere, and, with the
exception of Elam, the Sea-Country offered the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
possible line of retreat. We may assume, therefore,
that the marsh-dwellers of the south had been reinforced
for a considerable period by Sumerian refugees,
and, though the first three rulers of the new kingdom
bore Semitic names and were probably Semites, the
names of later rulers of the Sea-Country suggest that
the Sumerian element in the population afterwards
secured the control,<a name="FNanchor_7_433" id="FNanchor_7_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_433" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> no doubt with the assistance of
fresh drafts from their own kindred after their successful
occupation of Southern Babylonia. Under the more
powerful kings of the Second Dynasty, the kingdom
may have assumed a character resembling that of its
predecessors in Babylonia. The centre of administration
was certainly shifted for a time to Nippur, and
possibly even further north, but the Sea-Country, as
the home-land of the dynasty, must have always been
regarded as a dominant province of the kingdom, and it
offered a secure refuge to its rulers in the event of their
being driven again within its borders. In spite of its
extensive marshes, it was capable of sustaining its
inhabitants in a considerable degree of comfort, for the
date-palm flourished luxuriantly, and the areas under
cultivation must have been at least as productive as
those further to the north-west. Moreover, the zebu, or
humped cattle of Sumer, thrived in the swamps and
water-meadows, and not only formed an important
source of supply, but were used for ploughing in the
agricultural districts.<a name="FNanchor_8_434" id="FNanchor_8_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_434" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>With such a country as a base of operations, protected
in no small degree by its marshes, it is not
surprising that the Sea-Country kings should have met
with considerable success in their efforts at extending
the area of territory under their control.</p>

<p>After his second conflict with Iluma-ilum, Samsu-iluna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
appears to have reconciled himself to the loss of
his southern province, and to have made no further
effort at reconquest. He could still boast of successes
in other districts, for he destroyed the walls of Shakhnâ
and Zarkhanum, doubtless after the suppression of a
revolt, and he strengthened the fortifications of Kish.
He also retained the control of the Euphrates route to
Syria, and he doubtless encouraged the commercial
enterprise of Babylon in that direction as a set-off to
his losses in the south. We possess an interesting
illustration of the close relations he maintained with the
west in the date-formula for the twenty-sixth year of
his reign, which tells us that he procured a monolith
from the great mountain of the land of Amurru. This
must have been quarried in the Lebanon, and transported
overland to the Euphrates, and thence conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
by <i>kelek</i> to the capital. From the details he gives us
of its size, it appears to have measured some thirty-six
feet in length, and it was no small achievement to have
brought it so far to Babylon.</p>

</div>

<p>During this period of comparative tranquillity
Samsu-iluna devoted himself once more to rebuilding
and beautifying E-sagila and the temples of Kish and
Sippar; but in his twenty-eighth year Babylon suffered
a fresh shock, which appears to have resulted in still
further loss of territory. In that year he claims to have
slain Iadi-khabum and Muti-khurshana, two leaders of
an invasion, or a revolt, of which we have no details.
But it is clear that the victory, if such it was, resulted
in further trouble, for in the following two years no
fresh date-formulæ were promulgated, and it is probable
that the king himself was absent from the capital. It
is significant that no document has been recovered at
Nippur which is dated after Samsu-iluna's twenty-ninth
year, although in the preceding period, from the thirty-first
year of Hammurabi onward, when the city first
passed into Babylon's possession, nearly every year is
well represented in the dated series.<a name="FNanchor_9_435" id="FNanchor_9_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_435" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is difficult not
to conclude that Samsu-iluna now lost the control of
that city, and, since one of the documents from Nippur
is dated in Iluma-ilum's reign, it can only have passed
into the latter's possession. Further evidence of the
diminishing territory of Babylon may be seen in the
fact that Samsu-iluna should have rebuilt the old line
of fortresses, founded by his ancestor Suma-la-ilum at a
time when the kingdom was in its infancy.<a name="FNanchor_10_436" id="FNanchor_10_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_436" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This work
was doubtless undertaken when he foresaw the necessity
of defending the Akkadian border, and he must have
lost one at least of the fortresses, Dûr-Zakar, when
Nippur was taken. His activities during his closing
years were confined to the north and west, and to
the task of keeping open the Euphrates route. For he
cut a canal beside Kâr-Sippar, recovered possession of
Saggaratum, and probably destroyed the cities of
Arkum and Amal. His defeat of an Amorite force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
some two years before his death is of interest as proving
that the Western Semites of Akkad, nearly two centuries
after their settlement in the country, were experiencing
the same treatment from their own stock
that they themselves had caused to the land of their
adoption.</p>

<p>Samsu-iluna, with the possible exception of Ammi-ditana,
was the last great king of the West-Semitic
dynasty. It is true that his son Abi-eshu' made a fresh
attempt to dislodge Iluma-ilum from his hold upon
Central and Southern Babylonia. A late chronicle
records that he took the offensive and marched against
Iluma-ilum.<a name="FNanchor_11_437" id="FNanchor_11_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_437" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It would seem that his attack was in the
nature of a surprise, and that he succeeded in cutting off
the king and part of his forces, possibly on their return
from some other expedition. It is clear that he came
into touch with him in the neighbourhood of the Tigris,
and probably forced him to take refuge in a fortress,
since he attempted to cut off his retreat by damming
the river. He is said to have succeeded in damming
the stream, but he failed to catch Iluma-ilum. The
chronicle records no further conflict between the two,
and we may assume that he then adopted his father's
later policy of leaving the Sea-Country in possession of
its conquered territory. In some of his broken date-formulæ
we have echoes of a few further campaigns, and
we know that he cut the Abi-eshu' Canal, and built a
fortress at the gate of the Tigris, which he also named
after himself, Dûr-Abi-eshu'. This was probably a
frontier fortification, erected for the defence of the
river at the point where it passed from Babylon's area
of control to that of the Sea-Country. He also built
the town of Lukhaia on the Arakhtu Canal in the immediate
neighbourhood of Babylon. But both Abi-eshu'
and his successors on the throne give evidence
of having become more and more engrossed in cult-observances.
The supply of temple-furniture begins to
have for them the importance that military success had
for their fathers. And it is a symptom of decadence
that, even in the religious sphere, they are as much concerned
with their own worship as with that of the gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>It is significant that Abi-eshu' should have named
one of his years of rule by his decoration of a statue
of Entemena, the early patesi of Lagash, who had been
accorded divine honours, and, at some period after
Hammurabi's occupation of that city, had received a
cult-centre of his own in Babylon. For the act indicates
an increased interest, on Abi-eshu's part, in the
deification of royalty. This honour was peculiarly
associated with the possession of Nippur, the central
city and shrine of the country, and Babylon had adopted
the practice of deification for her kings after Nippur
had been annexed by Hammurabi. Though the city
had now passed from Babylon's control, Abi-eshu' did
not relinquish the privilege his father and grandfather
had legitimately enjoyed. Since Babylon no longer
possessed the central shrine of Enlil, in which his own
divine statue should have been set up, he dedicated one
in Enlil's local temple at Babylon. But not content
with that he fashioned no less than five other statues
of himself, which he set up in the temples of other gods,
at Babylon, Sippar and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_12_438" id="FNanchor_12_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_438" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>His three successors followed the same practice, and
Ammi-ditana and Ammi-zaduga, his son and grandson,
have left descriptions of some of these cult-images of
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_13_439" id="FNanchor_13_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_439" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> A favourite character, in which the king
was often represented, was holding a lamb for divination,
and another was in the attitude of prayer. The
later kings of the First Dynasty love, too, to dwell on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
their sumptuous votive offerings. Marduk is supplied
with innumerable weapons of red gold, and the Sun-god's
shrine at Sippar is decorated with solar disks of
precious <i>dushû</i>-stone, inlaid with red gold, lapis-lazuli,
and silver. Great reliefs, with representations of rivers
and mountains, were cast in bronze and set up in
the temples; and Samsu-ditana, the last of his line,
records among his offerings to the gods the dedication
to Sarpanitum of a rich silver casket for perfumes.</p>

<p>Incidentally, these references afford striking proof
of the wealth Babylon had now acquired, due no doubt
to her increased commercial activities. Elam on the
one side and Syria on the other<a name="FNanchor_14_440" id="FNanchor_14_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_440" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> had furnished her with
imports of precious stone, metal, and wood; and her
craftsmen had learnt much from foreign teachers. In
spite of the contraction of Hammurabi's empire, the
life of the people in both the town and country districts
of Akkad was not materially altered. The organized
supervision of all departments of national activity,
pastoral, agricultural and commercial, which the nation
owed in great measure to Hammurabi, was continued
under these later kings; and some of the royal letters
that have been recovered show that orders on comparatively
unimportant matters continued to be issued in
the king's name. We know, too, of a good many
public works carried out by Ammi-ditana, Abi-eshu's
son. He cut only one canal, and he built fortresses
for the protection of others, and named them alter
himself. Thus, in addition to the Ammi-ditana Canal,
we learn of a Dûr-Ammi-ditana, which he erected on
the Zilakum Canal, and another fortress of the same
name on the Mê-Enlil Canal. He strengthened the
wall of Ishkun-Marduk, which was also on the Zilakum,
and built Mashkan-Ammi-ditana and the wall of Kâr-Shamash,
both on the bank of the Euphrates.<a name="FNanchor_15_441" id="FNanchor_15_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_441" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>The systematic fortification of the rivers and canals
may perhaps be interpreted as marking an advance of
the frontier southward, in consequence of which it was
advisable to protect the crops and the water-supply of
the districts thus recovered from the danger of sudden
raids. On two occasions Ammi-ditana claims, in rather
vague terms, to have freed his land from danger, once
by restoring the might of Marduk, and later on by
loosing the pressure from his land; and that, in his
seventeenth year, he should have claimed to have conquered
Arakhab, perhaps referred to as "the Sumerian,"<a name="FNanchor_16_442" id="FNanchor_16_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_442" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
is an indication that the Sea-Country kings found ready
assistance from the older population of the South.
Moreover, of the later West-Semitic kings, Ammi-ditana
alone appears to have made headway against
the encroachments of the Sea-Country. The most
conclusive proof of his advance is to be seen in the
date-formula for his thirty-seventh year, which records
that he destroyed the wall of Nîsin,<a name="FNanchor_17_443" id="FNanchor_17_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_443" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> proving that
he had penetrated to the south of Nippur. That
Nippur itself was held by him for a time is more than
probable, especially as one of his building-inscriptions,
still unpublished, is said to have been found there<a name="FNanchor_18_444" id="FNanchor_18_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_444" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>;
and we know also, from a Neo-Babylonian copy of a
similar text, that he claimed the title "King of Sumer
and Akkad."<a name="FNanchor_19_445" id="FNanchor_19_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_445" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Under him, then, Babylon recovered a
semblance of her former strength, but we may conjecture
that the Sea-Country retained its hold on Larsa
and the southern group of cities.</p>

<p>We are furnished with a third valuable synchronism
between the dynasties of Babylon and of the south by
the reference to Ammi-ditana's destruction of the wall
of Nîsin, for the date-formula adds that this had been
erected by the people of Damiḳ-ilishu. The ruler
referred to is obviously the third king in the dynasty
of the Sea-Country, who succeeded Itti-ili-nibi upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
throne.<a name="FNanchor_20_446" id="FNanchor_20_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_446" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> We may conclude that it was in his reign, or
shortly after it, that Ammi-ditana succeeded in recovering
Nîsin, after having already annexed Nippur on his
southward advance. In his thirty-fourth year, two
years before the capture of Nîsin, he had dedicated an
image of Samsu-iluna in the temple E-namtila, and we
may perhaps connect this tribute to his grandfather with
the fact that in his reign Babylon had last enjoyed the
distinction conferred by the suzerainty of Nippur.</p>

<p>In the year following the recovery of Nîsin Ammi-zaduga
succeeded his father on the throne, and since
he ascribes the greatness of his kingdom to Enlil,
and not to Marduk or any other god, we may see in
this a further indication that Babylon continued to
control his ancient shrine. But the remaining date-formulæ
for Ammi-zaduga's reign do not suggest that
Ammi-ditana's conquests were held permanently. A
succession of religious dedications is followed in his
tenth year by the conventional record that he loosed
the pressure of his land, suggesting that his country
had been through a period of conflict; and, though in
the following year he built a fortress, Dûr-Ammi-zaduga
"at the mouth of the Euphrates," the nearly unbroken
succession of votive acts, commemorated during his remaining
years and in the reign of his son Samsu-ditana,
makes it probable that the kings of Sea-Country were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
gradually regaining some of the territory they had
temporarily lost.<a name="FNanchor_21_447" id="FNanchor_21_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_447" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>But it was not from the Sea-Country that the West-Semitic
Dynasty of Babylon received its death-blow.
In the late chronicle, which has thrown so much light
on the earlier conflicts of this troubled period, we read
of another invasion, which not only brought disaster to
Babylon but probably put an end to her first dynasty.
The chronicler states that during the reign of Samsu-ditana,
the last king of the dynasty, "men of the
land of Khatti marched against the land of Akkad,"
in other words, that Hittites from Anatolia<a name="FNanchor_22_448" id="FNanchor_22_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_448" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> marched
down the Euphrates and invaded Babylonia from the
north-west. The chronicle does not record the result
of the invasion,<a name="FNanchor_23_449" id="FNanchor_23_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_449" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> but we may probably connect it with
the fact that the Kassite king Agum-kakrime brought
back to Babylon from Khanî, the old Khana on the
middle Euphrates,<a name="FNanchor_24_450" id="FNanchor_24_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_450" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the cult-images of Marduk and
Sarpanitum and installed them once more with great
pomp and ceremony within their shrines in E-sagila.
We may legitimately conclude that they were carried
off by the Hittites during their invasion in Samsu-ditana's
reign.</p>

</div>

<p>If the Hittites succeeded in despoiling Babylon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
her most sacred deities, it is clear that they must have
raided the city, and they may even have occupied it for
a time. Thus the West-Semitic Dynasty of Babylon
may have been brought to an end by these Hittite
conquerors, and Samsu-ditana himself may have fallen
in defence of his own capital. But there is no reason
for supposing that the Hittites occupied Babylon for
long. Even if their success was complete, they
would soon have returned to their own country, laden
with heavy spoil; and they doubtless left some of their
number in occupation of Khana on their withdrawal up
the Euphrates. Southern Babylonia may also have
suffered in the raid, but we may assume that its force
was felt most in the north, and that the kings of the Sea-Country
profited by the disaster. We have as yet no
direct evidence of their occupation of Babylon, but, as
their kingdom had been Babylon's most powerful rival
prior to the Hittite raid, it may well have increased its
borders after her fall.</p>

<p>To this period we may probably assign a local
dynasty of Erech, represented by the names of Sin-gashid,
Sin-gamil and An-am. From bricks and
foundation-records recovered at Warka, the site of the
ancient city, we know that the first of these rulers
restored the old temple of E-anna and built himself a
new palace.<a name="FNanchor_25_451" id="FNanchor_25_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_451" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But the most interesting of Sin-gashid's
records is a votive cone, commemorating the dedication of
E-kankal to Lugal-banda and the goddess Ninsun, for,
when concluding his text with a prayer for abundance,
he inserts a list or tariff, stating the maximum-price
which he had fixed for the chief articles of commerce
during his reign,<a name="FNanchor_26_452" id="FNanchor_26_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_452" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Sin-gamil was An-am's immediate
predecessor on the throne of Erech, and during his reign
the latter dedicated on his behalf a temple to Nergal in
the town of Usipara.<a name="FNanchor_27_453" id="FNanchor_27_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_453" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> An-am was the son of a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Bêl-shemea, and his principal work was the restoration
of the wall of Erech, the foundation of which he
ascribes to the semi-mythical ruler Gilgamesh.<a name="FNanchor_28_454" id="FNanchor_28_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_454" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless other local kingdoms arose during the
period following Babylon's temporary disappearance as
a political force, but we have recovered no traces of
them,<a name="FNanchor_29_455" id="FNanchor_29_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_455" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and the only fact of which we are certain is the
continued succession of the Sea-Country kings. To
one of these rulers, Gulkishar, reference is made upon a
boundary stone of the twelfth century, drawn up in the
reign of Enlil-nadin-apli, an early king of the Fourth
Dynasty. On it he is given the title of King of the Sea-Country,
which is also the late chronicler's designation
for E-gamil, the last member of the dynasty, in the
account he has left us of the Kassite invasion. Such
evidence seems to show that the administrative centre
of their rule was established at those periods in the
south; but the inclusion of the dynasty in the Kings'
List is best explained on the assumption that at least
some of its later members imposed their suzerainty
over a wider area.<a name="FNanchor_30_456" id="FNanchor_30_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_456" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> They were evidently the only stable
line of rulers in a period after the most powerful
administration the country had yet known had been
suddenly shattered. The land had suffered much,
not only from the Hittite raid, but also during the
continuous conflicts of more than a century that preceded
the final fall of Babylon. It must have been
then that many of the old Sumerian cities of Southern
and Central Babylonia were deserted, after being burned
down and destroyed; and they were never afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
re-occupied. Lagash, Umma, Shuruppak, Kisurra and
Adab play no part in the subsequent history of
Babylonia.</p>

<p>Of the fortunes of Babylon at this time we know
nothing, but the fact that the Kassites should have
made the city their capital shows that the economic
forces, which had originally raised her to that position,
were still in operation. The Sumerian elements in the
population of Southern Babylonia may now have enjoyed
a last period of influence, and their racial survival
in the Sea-Country may in part explain its continual
striving for independence. But in Babylonia as a whole
the effects of three centuries of West-Semitic rule were
permanent. When, after the Kassite conquest, Babylon
emerges once more into view, it is apparent that the
traditions inherited from her first empire have undergone
small change.</p>

to that of the old Moon-temple at Ur; and on this evidence Poebel
has assumed that Abi-eshu' succeeded in getting control of Southern Babylonia
(cf. "Legal and Business Documents," p. 120). But a fuller form of
the date has since been recovered, showing that this E-gishshirgal, and
doubtless the temple of Enlil coupled with it, were in Babylon. It would
seem therefore that after Samsu-iluna had lost his hold upon the great centre
of the Moon-cult in the south, a local temple for the Moon-god's worship was
established at Babylon, under the ancient name, in which the old cult-practices
were reproduced as far as possible. Similarly, having lost Nippur, a new
shrine to Enlil was built at Babylon, or an old one enlarged and beautified.
By such means it was doubtless hoped to secure a continuance of the gods'
favour, and an ultimate recovery of their cities; and the continual dedication
of royal images, though doubtless a sign of royal deification, must also
have been intended to bring the king's claims to the divine notice.</p></div>

the last king of the earlier Dynasty of Nîsin, who perished one hundred and
thirty-seven years before this time. It is true that Nabonidus, to judge from
his building-inscriptions, evinces an interest in the past, but in many ways he
was a unique monarch and he lived in a later age. These early date-formulæ,
on the other hand, always refer to contemporaneous events, not to matters of
archæological interest. We know definitely that Iluma-ilum (the first Sea-Country
king) was the contemporary of Samsu-iluna and Abi-eshu', and it is
not unreasonable to find a reference to Damiḳ-ilishu (the third Sea-Country
king) in the last year of Ammi-ditana, Abi-eshu's son. Granting this assumption,
there follows the important inference that the exceptionally long period
of one hundred and fifteen years, assigned by the Kings' List to the reigns of
the first two kings of the Sea-Country, is a little exaggerated. The accuracy
of some of the longer figures assigned in the List to kings of this dynasty has
long been called in question (cf. "Chronicles," I., pp. 111 ff., and see
above, p. 106), and the synchronism justifies this doubt. While the historical
character of the Second Dynasty has been amply confirmed, we must not
regard the total duration assigned to it in the Kings' List as more than
approximately correct. Under these circumstances detailed dates have not
been assigned to members of that dynasty in the Dynastic List of Kings;
see Appendix II., p. 320.</p></div>

one of his later years commemorating that he had brightened his land like

with the weapon of Marduk. How far these rather vague claims were justified
it is impossible to say. Apart from votive acts, the only definite record of
this period is that of Ammi-zaduga's sixteenth year, in which he celebrates
the cutting of the Ammi-zaduga-nukhush-nishi Canal.</p></div>

twelfth century, Northern Syria was known as "the land of Khatti," but, if
the invasion of Babylonia in Samsu-ditana's reign had been made by Semitic
tribes from Syria, no doubt the chronicler would have employed the correct
designation, Amurru, which is used in an earlier section of the text for
Sargon's invasion of Syria. In the late omen-literature, too, the use of the
early geographical terms is not confused. Both chronicles and omen-texts
are transcripts of early written originals, not late compilations based on

<h4>THE KASSITE DYNASTY AND ITS RELATIONS WITH
EGYPT AND THE HITTITE EMPIRE</h4>


<p>The Kassite conquest of Babylonia, though it met
with immediate success in a great part of the
country, was a gradual process in the south,
being carried out by independent Kassite chieftains.
The Sea-Country kings continued for a time their
independent existence; and even after that dynasty
was brought to an end, the struggle for the south went
on. It was after a further period of conflict that the
Kassite domination was completed, and the administration
of the whole country centred once more in
Babylon. It is fortunate for Babylonia that the new
invaders did not appear in such numbers as to over-whelm
the existing population. The probability has
long been recognized that they were Aryan by race, and
we may with some confidence regard them as akin to
the later rulers of Mitanni, who imposed themselves
upon the earlier non-Iranian population of Subartu, or
Northern Mesopotamia. Like the Mitannian kings, the
Kassites of Babylonia were a ruling caste or aristocracy,
and, though they doubtless brought with them
numbers of humbler followers, their domination did
not affect the linguistic nor the racial character of the
country in any marked degree. In some of its aspects
we may compare their rule to that of Turkey in the
Tigris and Euphrates valley. They give no evidence
of having possessed a high degree of culture, and
though they gradually adopted the civilization of
Babylon, they tended for long to keep themselves
aloof, retaining their native names along with their
separate nationality. They were essentially a practical
people and produced successful administrators. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
chief gain they brought to Babylon was an improved
method of time-reckoning. In place of the unwieldy
system of date-formulæ, inherited by the Semites from
the Sumerians, under which each year was known by
an elaborate title taken from some great event or cult-observance,
the Kassites introduced the simpler plan
of dating by the years of the king's reign. And we
shall see that it was directly owing to the political
circumstances of their occupation that the old system
of land tenure, already to a great extent undermined by
the Western Semites, was still further modified.</p>

<p>But, on the material side, the greatest change they
effected in the life of Babylonia was due to their introduction
of the horse. There can be little doubt that
they were a horse-keeping race,<a name="FNanchor_1_457" id="FNanchor_1_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_457" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the success of their
invasion may in large part be traced to their greater
mobility. Hitherto asses and cattle had been employed
for all purposes of draught and carriage, but, with
the appearance of the Kassites, the horse suddenly
becomes the beast of burden throughout Western Asia.
Before their time "the ass of the mountain," as it was
designated in Babylonia, was a great rarity, the earliest
reference to it occurring in the age of Hammurabi.<a name="FNanchor_2_458" id="FNanchor_2_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_458" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In
that period we have evidence that Kassite tribes were
already forming settlements in the western districts of
Elam, and when from time to time small parties of
them made their way into the Babylonian plain to be
employed as harvesters,<a name="FNanchor_3_459" id="FNanchor_3_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_459" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> they doubtless carried their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
goods with them in the usual way. The usefulness
of horses imported in this manner would have ensured
their ready sale to the Babylonians, who probably
retained the services of their owners to tend the strange
animals. But the early Kassite immigrants must have
been men of a simple and unprogressive type, for in all
the contract-literature of the period we find no trace of
their acquiring wealth, or engaging in the commercial
activities of their adopted country. The only evidence
of their employment in other than a menial capacity is
supplied by a contract of Ammi-ditana's reign, which
records a two-years' lease of an uncultivated field taken
by a Kassite for farming.<a name="FNanchor_4_460" id="FNanchor_4_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_460" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The Kassite raid into Babylonian territory in Samsu-iluna's
reign<a name="FNanchor_5_461" id="FNanchor_5_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_461" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> may have been followed by others of a
like character, but it was only at the time of the later
kings of the Sea-Country that the invaders succeeded in
effecting a permanent foothold in Northern Babylonia.
According to the Kings' List the founder of the Third
Dynasty was Gandash, and we have obtained confirmation
of the record in a Neo-Babylonian tablet purporting
to contain a copy of one of his inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_6_462" id="FNanchor_6_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_462" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
Babylonian king, whose text the copy reproduces, there
bears the name Gaddash, evidently a contracted form
of Gandash as written in the Kings' List; and the
record contains an unmistakable reference to the Kassite
conquest. From what is left of the inscription it may
be inferred that it commemorated the restoration of the
temple of Bêl, that is, of Marduk, which seems to have
been damaged "in the conquest of Babylon." It is clear,
therefore, that Babylon must have offered a strenuous
opposition to the invaders, and that the city held out
until captured by assault. It would seem, too, that
this success was followed up by further conquests of
Babylonian territory, for in his text, in addition to
styling himself King of Babylon, Gaddash adopts the
other time-honoured titles of King of the four quarters
(of the world), and King of Sinner and Akkad. We
may see evidence in this that the kingdom of the Sea-Country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
was now restricted within its original limits,
though some attempts may have been made to stem
the tide of invasion. Ea-gamil, at any rate, the last
king of the Second Dynasty, was not content to defend
his home-territory, for we know that he assumed the
offensive and invaded Elam. But he appears to have
met with no success, and after his death a Kassite
chieftain, Ula-Burariash or Ulam-Buriash, conquered
the Sea-Country and established his dominion there.<a name="FNanchor_7_463" id="FNanchor_7_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_463" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The late chronicler, who records these events, tells
us that Ulam-Buriash was the brother of Kashtiliash,
the Kassite, whom we may probably identify with the
third ruler of the Kassite Dynasty of Babylon. There
Gandash, the founder of the dynasty, had been succeeded
by his son Agum, but after the hitter's reign of twenty-two
years Kashtiliash, a rival Kassite, had secured the
throne.<a name="FNanchor_8_464" id="FNanchor_8_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_464" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He evidently came of a powerful Kassite tribe,
for it was his brother, Ulam-Buriash, who conquered
the Country of the Sea. We have recovered a memorial
of the latter's reign in a knob or mace-head of diorite.
which was found during the excavations at Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_9_465" id="FNanchor_9_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_465" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
On it he terms himself King of the Sea-Country, and
we learn from it, too, that he and his brother were the
sons of Burna-Burariash, or Burna-Buriash, who may
have remained behind as a local Kassite chieftain in
Elam, while his sons between them secured the control
of Babylonia. After a certain interval the Sea-Country
must have revolted from Ulam-Buriash, for its reconquest
was undertaken by Agum, a younger son of
Kashtiliash, who is recorded to have captured the city
of Dûr-Enlil and to have destroyed E-malga-uruna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>,
the local temple of Enlil.<a name="FNanchor_10_466" id="FNanchor_10_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_466" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The eldest son of Kashtiliash
had meanwhile succeeded his father on the throne of
Babylon, and, if Agum established his rule in the Sea-Country,
we again have the spectacle of two brothers,
in the next generation of this Kassite family, dividing
the control of Babylonia between them. But as the
chronicler does not record that Agum, like his uncle
Ulam-Buriash, exercised dominion over the Sea-Country
as a whole, he may have secured little more than a local
success. The throne of Babylon then passed to the
second son of Kashtiliash, Abi-rattash, and it was possibly
by him, or by one of his successors, that the whole
country was once more united under Babylon's rule.</p>

<p>We know of two more members of the family of
Kashtiliash, who carried on his line at Babylon. For
Abi-rattash was succeeded by his son and grandson,
Tashshi-gurumash and Agum-kakrime, of whom the
latter has left us the record already referred to, commemorating
his recovery of the statues of Marduk and
Sarpanitum from the land of Khanî.<a name="FNanchor_11_467" id="FNanchor_11_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_467" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And then there
occurs a great break in our knowledge of the history of
Babylon. For a period extending over some thirteen
reigns, from about the middle of the seventeenth to the
close of the fifteenth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, our native evidence
is confined to a couple of brief records, dating from the
latter half of the interval, and to one or two historical
references in later texts. By their help we have
recovered the names of a few of the missing kings,
though their relative order, and in one or two cases
even their existence, are still matters of controversy.
In fact, were we dependent solely upon Babylonian
sources, our knowledge of the country's history, even
when we can again establish the succession, would have
been practically a blank. But, thanks in great part to
the commercial relations established with Syria since
the age of the West-Semitic kings, the influence of
Babylonian culture had travelled far afield. Her method
of writing on the convenient and imperishable clay
tablet had been adopted by other nations of Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Asia, and her language had become the <i>lingua franca</i>
of the ancient world. After her conquest of Canaan,
Egypt had become an Asiatic power, and had adopted
the current method of international intercourse for
communication with other great states and with her
own provinces in Canaan. And thus it has come about
that some of our most striking information on the
period has come to us, not from Babylon itself, but
from Egypt.</p>

<p>The mounds known as Tell el-Amarna in Upper
Egypt mark the site of a city which had a brief but
brilliant existence under Amen-hetep IV., or Akhenaten,
one of the later kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty.
He was the famous "heretic" king, who attempted to
suppress the established religion of Egypt and to substitute
for it a pantheistic monotheism associated with
the worship of the solar disk. In pursuance of his
religious ideas he deserted Thebes, the ancient capital
of the country, and built a new capital further to the
north, which he called Akhetaten,<a name="FNanchor_12_468" id="FNanchor_12_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_468" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the modern Tell el-Amarna.
Here he transferred the official records of
his own government and those of his father, Amenhetep
III., including the despatches from Egypt's
Asiatic provinces and the diplomatic correspondence
with kings of Mesopotamia, Assyria and Babylon.
Some twenty-seven years ago a large number of these
were discovered in the ruins of the royal palace, and
they form one of the most valuable sources of information
on the early relations of Egypt and Western Asia.<a name="FNanchor_13_469" id="FNanchor_13_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_469" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
More recently they have been supplemented by a still
larger find of similar documents at Boghaz Keui in
Cappadocia, a village built beside the site of Khatti, the
ancient capital of the Hittite empire. The royal and
official archives had been stored for safety on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
ancient citadel, and the few extracts that have as yet
been published, from the many thousands of documents
recovered on the site, have furnished further information
of the greatest value from the Hittite standpoint.<a name="FNanchor_14_470" id="FNanchor_14_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_470" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>From these documents we have recovered a very
full picture of international politics in Western Asia
during two centuries, from the close of the fifteenth to
the later years of the thirteenth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> We can
trace in some measure the dynastic relations established
by Egypt with the other great Asiatic states, and the
manner in which the balance of power was maintained,
largely by diplomatic methods. During the earlier
part of this period Egyptian power is dominant in
Palestine and Syria, while the kingdom of Mitanni, under
its Aryan dynasty, is a check upon Assyrian expansion.
But Egypt was losing her hold upon her Asiatic
provinces, and the rise of the Hittite empire coincided
with her decline in power. Mitanni soon fell before the
Hittites, to the material advantage of Assyria, which
began to be a menace to her neighbours upon the west
and south. After a change of dynasty, Egypt had meanwhile
in part recovered her lost territory in Palestine,
and once more took her place among the great nations of
Western Asia. And it is only with the fall of the Hittite
empire that the international situation is completely
altered. Throughout Babylon stands, so far as she may,
aloof, preoccupied with commerce rather than with
conquest;<a name="FNanchor_15_471" id="FNanchor_15_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_471" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but in the latter half of the period her eyes
are always fixed upon her Assyrian frontier.</p>

<p class="caption">HEAD OF A COLOSSAL STATUE OF AMEN-HETEP III</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>From the Tell el-Amarna correspondence we see how
the kings of Mitanni, Assyria and Babylon gave their
daughters to the Egyptian king in marriage and sought
to secure his friendship and alliance. Apparently Egypt
considered it beneath her dignity to bestow her princesses
in return, for in one of his letters to Amen-hetep
III. Kadashman-Enlil remonstrates with the King of
Egypt for refusing him one of his daughters and
threatens to withhold his own daughter in retaliation.<a name="FNanchor_16_472" id="FNanchor_16_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_472" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Another of the letters illustrates in a still more striking
manner the intimate international intercourse of the
period. At the height of its power the kingdom of
Mitanni appears to have annexed the southern districts
of Assyria, and for a time to have exercised control
over Nineveh, as Hammurabi of Babylon had done in
an earlier age. It was in his character of suzerain that
Dushratta sent the holy statue of Ishtar of Nineveh to
Egypt, as a mark of his esteem for Amen-hetep III.
We have recovered the letter he sent with the goddess,
in which he writes concerning her:<a name="FNanchor_17_473" id="FNanchor_17_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_473" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> " Indeed in the time
of my father the lady Ishtar went into that land; and,
just as she dwelt there formerly and they honoured her,
so now may my brother honour her ten times more than
before. May my brother honour her and may he allow
her to return with joy." We thus gather that this was
not the first time Ishtar had visited Egypt, and we may
infer from such a custom the belief that a deity, when
stopping in a foreign country with his or her own
consent, would, if properly treated, confer favour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
prosperity upon that land. We shall see later on that
Rameses II. sent his own god Khonsu on a similar
mission to Khatti, in order to cure the epileptic daughter
of the Hittite king, who was believed to be possessed by
a devil.<a name="FNanchor_18_474" id="FNanchor_18_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_474" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> We could not have more striking proofs of
international intercourse. Not only did the rulers of
the great states exchange their daughters but even their
gods.</p>

<p>But the letters also exhibit the jealousy which
existed between the rival states of Asia. By skilful
diplomacy, and, particularly in the reign of Akhenaten,
by presents and heavy bribes, the Egyptian king and
his advisers succeeded in playing off one power against
the other, and in retaining some hold upon their troublesome
provinces of Syria and Palestine. In paying liberal
bounties and rewards to his own followers and party in
Egypt itself, Akhenaten was only carrying out the traditional
policy of the Egyptian crown;<a name="FNanchor_19_475" id="FNanchor_19_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_475" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and he extended
the principle still more in his dealings with foreign states.
But peculation on the part of the ambassadors was only
equalled by the greed of the monarchs to whom they
were accredited, and whose appetite for Egyptian gold
grew with their consumption of it. Much space in the
letters is given up to the constant request for more
presents, and to complaints that promised gifts have not
arrived. In one letter, for example, Ashur-uballit of
Assyria writes to Akhenaten that formerly the king of
Khanirabbat had received a present of twenty manehs of
gold from Egypt, and he proceeds to demand a like
sum.<a name="FNanchor_20_476" id="FNanchor_20_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_476" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Burna-Buriash of Babylon, his contemporary,
writes in the same strain to Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_21_477" id="FNanchor_21_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_477" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> reminding Akhenaten
that Amenophis III. had been far more generous to his
father. "Since the time my father and thine established
friendly relations with one another, they sent rich
presents to one another, and they did not refuse to one
another any desired object. Now my brother has sent
me as a present two manehs of gold. Send now much
gold, as much as thy father; and if it is less, send but
half that of thy father. Why hast thou sent only two
manehs of gold? For the work in the temple is great,
and I have undertaken it and am carrying it out with
vigour; therefore send much gold. And do thou send
for whatsoever thou desirest in my land, that they may
take it thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Though a great part of the royal letters from Tell el-Amarna
is taken up with such rather wearisome
requests for gold, they also give valuable glimpses into
the political movements of the time. We gather, for
instance, that Egypt succeeds in preventing Babylon
from giving support to the revolts in Canaan, but she
does not hesitate to encourage Assyria, which is now
beginning to display her power as Babylon's rival.
Burna-Buriash makes this clear when he complains that
Akhenaten has received an embassy from the Assyrians,
whom he boastfully refers to as his subjects; and he
contrasts Babylon's own reception of Canaanite proposals
of alliance against Egypt in the time of his father
Kurigalzu. "In the time of Kurigalzu, my father," he
writes, "the Canaanites sent to him with one accord,
saying, 'Let us go down against the border of the land
and invade it, and let us form an alliance with thee.'
But my father replied to them, saying, 'Desist from
seeking to form an alliance with me. If ye are hostile
to the king of Egypt, my brother, and ally yourselves
with one another, shall I not come and plunder you?
For with me is he allied.' My father for thy father's
sake did not hearken to them."<a name="FNanchor_22_478" id="FNanchor_22_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_478" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But Burna-Buriash
does not trust entirely to the Egyptian's sense of gratitude
for Babylon's support in the past. He reinforces his
argument by a present of three manehs of lapis-lazuli,
five yoke of horses and five wooden chariots. Lapis-lazuli
and horses were the two most valuable exports
from Babylon during the Kassite period, and they
counterbalanced to some extent Egypt's almost inexhaustible
supply of Nubian gold.</p>

<p>Babylon at this time had no territorial ambitions
outside the limit of her own frontiers. She was never
menaced by Mitanni, and it was only after the fall of
the latter kingdom that she began to be uneasy at the
increase of Assyrian power.<a name="FNanchor_23_479" id="FNanchor_23_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_479" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Apart from the defence
of her frontier, her chief preoccupation was to keep the
trade-routes open, especially the Euphrates route to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Syria and the north. Thus we find Burna-Buriash
remonstrating with Egypt when the caravans of one
of his messengers, named Salmu, had been plundered
by two Canaanite chiefs, and demanding compensation.<a name="FNanchor_24_480" id="FNanchor_24_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_480" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
On another occasion he writes that Babylonian merchants
had been robbed and slain at Khinnatuni in Canaan,<a name="FNanchor_25_481" id="FNanchor_25_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_481" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
and he again holds Akhenaten responsible. "Canaan
is thy land," he says, "and its kings are thy servants;"
and he demands that the losses should be made good
and the murderers slain.<a name="FNanchor_26_482" id="FNanchor_26_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_482" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But Egypt was at this period
so busy with her own affairs that she had not the time,
nor even the power, to protect the commercial interests
of her neighbours. For in the majority of the Tell el-Amarna
letters we see her Asiatic empire falling to
pieces.<a name="FNanchor_27_483" id="FNanchor_27_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_483" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> From Northern Syria to Southern Palestine
the Egyptian governors and vassal rulers vainly attempt
to quell rebellion and to hold back invading tribes.</p>

<p>The source of a good deal of the trouble was the great
Hittite power, away to the north in the mountains of
Anatolia. The Hittite kings had formed a confederation
of their own peoples north of the Taurus, and they
were now pressing southwards into Phœnicia and the
Lebanon. They coveted the fertile plains of Northern
Syria, and Egypt was the power that blocked their path.
They were not at first strong enough to challenge
Egypt by direct invasion of her provinces, so they confined
themselves to stirring up rebellion among the native
princes of Canaan. These they encouraged to throw off
the Egyptian yoke, and to attack those cities which
refused to join them. The loyal chiefs and governors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
appealed for help to Egypt, and their letters show that
they generally appealed in vain. For Akhenaten was
a weak monarch, and was far more interested in his
heretic worship of the Solar Disk than in retaining the
foreign empire he had inherited. It was in his reign
that the Anatolian Hittites began to take an active part
in the politics of Western Asia.</p>

</div>

<p>Until the discovery of the documents at Boghaz
Keui, it had only been possible to deduce the existence
of the Hittites from the mark they had left in the
records of Egypt and Assyria; and at that time it was
not even certain whether we might regard as their
work the hieroglyphic rock-inscriptions, which are
scattered over a great part of Asia Minor. But it is
now possible to supplement our material from native
sources, and to trace the gradual extension of their power
by both conquest and diplomacy. They were a virile
race, and their strongly marked features may be still
seen, not only on their own rock-sculptures, but also in
Egyptian reliefs beside those of other Asiatics.<a name="FNanchor_28_484" id="FNanchor_28_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_484" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>  In facial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
type, too, they are quite distinct, for the nose, though
prominent and slightly curved, is not very fleshy, mouth
and chin are small, and the forehead recedes abruptly,
with the hair drawn back from it and falling in one, or
possibly in two plaits, or pig-tails, on the shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_29_485" id="FNanchor_29_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_485" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It is
still not certain to which of the great families of nations
they belonged. The suggestion has been made that
their language has certain Indo-European characteristics,
but for the present it is safer to regard them as an
indigenous race of Asia Minor.<a name="FNanchor_30_486" id="FNanchor_30_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_486" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Their facial type in
any case suggests comparison as little with Aryan as
with Semitic stock.</p>

<p>Their civilization was strongly influenced by that of
Babylonia, perhaps through the medium of Assyrian
trading settlements, which were already established in
Cappadocia in the second half of the third millennium.
From these early Semitic immigrants, or their successors,
they borrowed the clay tablet and the cuneiform system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of writing. But they continued to use their own picture-characters
for monumental records; and even in the later
period, when they came into direct contact with the
Assyrian empire, their art never lost its individual
character. Some of the most elaborate of their rock-sculptures
still survive in the holy sanctuary at Yasili
Kaya, not far from Boghaz Keui. Here on the rock-face,
in a natural fissure of the mountain, are carved the
figures of their deities, chief among them the great
Mother-goddess of the Hittites.</p>

<p>She and Teshub, the principal male deity, are here represented meeting, with

was from precisely this area that the Hittite tribes
descended on their raid down the Euphrates, which
hastened the fall of Babylon's First Dynasty and
perhaps brought it to an end, we have as yet no means
of judging.<a name="FNanchor_31_487" id="FNanchor_31_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_487" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But during the subsequent centuries we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
may certainly picture a slow but uninterrupted expansion
of the area under Hittite control; and it is probable
that authority was divided among the various local
kingdoms and chieftainships, which occupied the valleys
and upland stretches to the north of the Taurus.</p>

<p>At the time of their empire, their capital and central
fortress was Khatti, which lay to the east of the Halys,
on the Anatolian plateau some three thousand feet
above sea-level. It occupied a strong position near the
crossing of the great lines of traffic through Asia Minor;
and expansion from this area must have begun to take
place at an early period beyond the west bank of the
river, where the country offered greater facilities for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
pasturage. Another line of advance was southward to
the coast-plains beneath the Taurus, and it is certain
that Cilicia was occupied by Hittite tribes before any
attempt was made on Northern Syria. That at first
the Hittites were scattered, without any central organization,
among a number of independent city-states, may
be inferred from their later records. For when a land
is referred to in their official documents, it is designated
"the country of the city of so and so," suggesting that
each important township had been the centre of an
independent district to which it gave its name. Some
of the Hittite states attained in time to a considerable
degree of importance. Thus we find Tarkundaraba of
Arzawa sufficiently eminent to marry a daughter of
Amen-hetep III. of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_32_488" id="FNanchor_32_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_488" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Another city was Kussar,
one of whose kings, Khattusil I., was the father of
Shubbiluliuma, under whom the Hittites were organized
into a strong confederacy which endured for nearly two
hundred years. It must have been owing to its strategic
importance that Shubbiluliuma selected Khatti as his
capital in place of his ancestral city.</p>

<p>Quite apart from its name, and from the traditions
attaching to it, there can be no question but that from
this time forward Khatti was the centre of Hittite
power and civilization; for it is by far the most extensive
Hittite site in existence. It covers the high
ground, including the hill-top, above Boghaz Keui,
which lies in the valley below; and it is fortunate that
the greater part of the modern village was built clear
of the outer boundaries of the ancient city, as the ruins
have in consequence run far less risk of destruction.<a name="FNanchor_33_489" id="FNanchor_33_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_489" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
It was placed high for purely strategic purposes, commanding
as it does the Royal Road from the west and
the great trunk-road from the south as they approach
the city-walls. The citadel was formed by a flat-topped
hill,<a name="FNanchor_34_490" id="FNanchor_34_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_490" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> which dominates the walled city to the north,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
west, and south of it. Its precipitous slopes descend
on the north-east side to a mountain stream outside
the walls; and a similar stream, fed by shallow gullies,
flows north-westward through the city-area. From the
point where they rise in the south, to their junction
below the city, the ground falls no less than a thousand
feet, and the uneven surface has been fully utilized for
its defence. The wall which surrounded the southern
and higher half of the city is still comparatively well
preserved, and forms three sides of a rough hexagon,
but the falling and broken ground to the north prevented
a symmetrical completion of the circuit. A
series of interior fortification-walls, following the slope
of the ground, enclosed a number of irregular areas,
subsidiary forts being constructed on four smaller hills
along the most southerly cross-wall, which shut in the
highest part of the city.</p>

<p>The city's greatest length from north to south was

three-quarters of a mile, the whole circuit of the existing
defences, including the lower-lying area, extending
to some three and a half miles. This is a remarkable
size for a mountain city, and although some portions of
the area cannot have been occupied by buildings, the
fortification of so extensive a site is an indication of the
power of the Hittite empire and its capital. About
fourteen feet in thickness, the wall is preserved in many
places to a hight of more than twelve feet. It consists
of an inner and an outer wall, filled in with a stone
packing. The outer face was naturally the stronger of
the two, and huge stones, sometimes five feet in length,
have been employed in its construction. The wall was
strengthened by towers, set at more or less regular
intervals along it, their position being sometimes
dictated by the contour of the ground. Round a
great part of the circuit there are traces of an outer
defensive wall of lighter construction and with smaller
towers, but this was not continuous, being omitted
wherever the natural fall of the ground was a sufficient
protection to the main wall.</p>

<p class="caption">CONJECTURAL RESTORATION OF A HITTITE GATEWAY VIEWED FROM INSIDE.</p>

<p class="caption2">It is possible that brick was employed for the upper structure of the city-wall
and its towers, as suggested in the restoration. In such a case it is not
unlikely that the stepped battlements of Mesopotamia were also adopted.</p>

<p class="caption">(After Puchstein.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>Projecting towers also flanked the main gateways,
which exhibit a characteristic feature of Hittite architecture.
This is the peculiar form of the gateway,
consisting of a pointed arch with gently sloping sides,
the latter formed by huge monoliths bonded into the
structure of the wall.<a name="FNanchor_35_491" id="FNanchor_35_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_491" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It would seem that brick was
probably employed for the upper structure of both wall
and towers; and in other buildings of the city, such as
the great temple to the north-west of the citadel, brick
was used for the upper structure of the walls upon a
stone foundation. Whenever the use of brick was
adopted in one of the northern lands of Mesopotamia,
where stone is plentiful, the latter was always used in
the foundations. It is not improbable, therefore, that
the stepped battlements of Assyria and Babylon were
also borrowed, as that was the most convenient and
decorative way of finishing off the upper courses of a
fortification-wall built of that material.</p>

<p>In the earlier years of Shubbiluliuma the city was
doubtless very much smaller than it subsequently
became. But he used it effectively as a base, and, as
much by diplomatic means as by actual conquest, he
succeeded in making the power of the Hittites felt
beyond their own borders. The Syrian revolts in the
reign of Amen-hetep III., by which the authority of
Egypt was weakened in her Asiatic provinces, undoubtedly
received Hittite encouragement. Shubbiluliuma
also crossed the Euphrates and ravaged the
northern territory of Mitanni, the principal rival of the
Hittites up to that time. Later he invaded Syria in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
force and returned to his mountain fastness of Khatti,
laden with spoil and leading two Mitannian princes as
captives in his train. On the accession of Akhenaten,
Shubbiluliuma wrote him a letter of congratulation;
but, when the Syrian prince Aziru acknowledged the
suzerainty of Egypt, Shubbiluliuma defeated him and
laid the whole of Northern Syria under tribute, subsequently
confirming his possession of the country by
treaty with Egypt. The state of Mitanni, too, submitted
to Shubbiluliuma's dictation, for, on the murder
of its powerful king Dushratta, he espoused the cause
of Mattiuaza, whom he restored to his father's throne
after marrying him to his daughter. We have recovered
the text of his treaty with Mitanni, and it reflects the
despotic power of the Hittite king at this time. Referring
to himself in the third person he says, "The great
king, for the sake of his daughter, gave the country of
Mitanni a new life."<a name="FNanchor_36_492" id="FNanchor_36_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_492" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

the latter country, and the restoration of her old religion,
had strengthened the government, and now led to
renewed attempts on her part at recovering her lost
territory. On the first occasion the Hittites were
defeated by Seti I. in the north of Syria, and Egypt
reoccupied Phoenicia and Canaan. Later on, probably
in the reign of Mutallu, Mursil's son, Rameses II.
attempted to recover Northern Syria. At the battle of
Kadesh, on the Orontes, he succeeded in defeating the
Hittite army, though both sides lost heavily and at an
early stage of the fight Rameses himself was in imminent
danger of capture. Episodes in the battle may still be
seen pictured in relief on the temple-walls at Luxor,
Karnak and Abydos.<a name="FNanchor_37_493" id="FNanchor_37_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_493" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The Egyptian war was continued with varying
success, though it is certain that the Hittites were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
eventually successful in the north. But in the reign of
Khattusil, the brother of Mutallu, both sides were
weary of the conflict, and an elaborate treaty of peace
and alliance was drawn up. This, when engraved upon
a silver tablet, was carried to Egypt by an ambassador
and presented to Rameses. The contents of the treaty
have long been known from the Egyptian text, engraved
on the walls of the temple at Karnak; and
among the tablets found at Boghaz Keui was a broken
copy of the original Hittite version,<a name="FNanchor_38_494" id="FNanchor_38_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_494" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> drawn up in
cuneiform characters and in Babylonian, the language
of diplomacy at the period. Khattusil also maintained
friendly relations with the Babylonian court, and he
informed the king of Babylon of his treaty with the
king of Egypt. It is clear from a copy of the letter,
recovered at Boghaz Keui, that the Babylonian king
had heard about the treaty and had written to enquire
concerning it. Khattusil replies that the king of
Egypt and he had formed a friendship and had concluded
an alliance: "We are brothers, and against a foe will
we fight together, and with a friend will we together
maintain friendship."<a name="FNanchor_39_495" id="FNanchor_39_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_495" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> And his next remark enables
us to identify his Kassite correspondent; for he adds,
"and when the king of Egypt [formerly] attacked
[Khatti], then did I write to inform thy father Kadashman-turgu."
Khattusil was thus the contemporary of
two Kassite kings, Kadashman-turgu and Kadashman-Enlil
II., the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth rulers of
the dynasty.</p>

<p>Another section of this letter is of considerable
interest, as it shows that an attempt by Khattusil to
intervene in Babylonian politics had been resented,
and had led to a temporary estrangement between the
two countries. Khattusil is at pains to reassure
Kadashman-Enlil as to the unselfishness of his motives,
explaining that the action he had taken had been
dictated entirely by the Kassite king's own interests.
The episode had occurred on the death of Kadashman-turgu,
and, according to Khattusil's account, he had at
once written to Babylon to say that, unless the succession
of Kadashman-Enlil, who was then a boy, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
recognized, he would break off the alliance he had
concluded with the late king, Kadasman-Enlil's father.
The Babylonian chief minister, Itti-Marduk-balâtu, had
taken offence at the tone of the letter, and had replied
that the Hittite king had not written in the tone of
brotherhood, but had issued his commands as though
the Babylonians were his vassals. As a result, diplomatic
negotiations had been broken off during the
young king's minority; but he had now attained his
majority, and had taken the direction of affairs from his
minister's hands into his own. The long communication
from Khattusil must have been written shortly
after the resumption of diplomatic intercourse.</p>

<p>After giving these explanations of his present
relations with Egypt, and of his former discontinuance
of negotiations with Babylon, Khattusil passes on to
matters which doubtless had furnished the occasion
for his letter. Certain Babylonian merchants, when
journeying by caravan to Amurru and Ugarit, a town in
Northern Phœnicia, had been murdered; and, as the
responsibility lay on the Hittite empire in its character
of suzerain, Kudashman-Enlil had apparently addressed
to Khattusil the demand that the guilty parties should
be handed over to the relatives of the murdered men.
The reference is of interest, as it gives further proof of
Babylon's commercial activities in the West, and shows
how, after Egypt had lost her control of Northern
Syria, the Kassite rulers addressed themselves to its
new suzerain to secure protection for their caravans.</p>

<p>We have evidence that such diplomatic action was
thoroughly effective, for not only had Babylon's language
and system of writing penetrated Western Asia, but her
respect for law and her legislative methods had accompanied
them, at any rate within the Hittite area. The
point is well illustrated by one of the last sections in
this remarkable letter, which deals with a complaint by
the Babylonian king concerning some action of the
Amorite prince, Banti-shinni. The Amorite, when
accused by Khattusil of having "troubled the land"
of Kadashman-Enlil, had replied by advancing a
counterclaim for thirty talents of silver against the
inhabitants of Akkad. After stating this fact, Khattusil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
continues in his letter: "Now, since Banti-Shinni
has become my vassal, let my brother prosecute the
claim against him; and, concerning the troubling of my
brother's land, he shall make his defence before the god<a name="FNanchor_40_496" id="FNanchor_40_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_496" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
in the presence of thy ambassador, Adad-shar-ilâni.
And if my brother will not conduct the action (himself),
then shall thy servant come who has heard that
Banti-Shinni harassed my brother's land, and he shall
conduct the action. Then will I summon Banti-Shinni
to answer the charge. He is (my) vassal. If he
harasses my brother, does he not then harass me?"<a name="FNanchor_41_497" id="FNanchor_41_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_497" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>It may be that Hittite diplomacy is here making use of
the Babylonian respect for law, to find a way out of a
difficult situation; but the mere proposal of such a trial
as that suggested proves that the usual method of
settling international disputes of a minor character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
was modelled on Babylon's internal legislative system.
It is clear that the Hittite was anxious to prevent
strained relations with Babylon, for he goes on to urge
Kadashman-Enlil to attack a common enemy, whom he
does not name. This must have been Assyria, whose
growing power had become a menace to both states, and
had caused them to draw together for mutual support.</p>

<p>The account that has been given of this lengthy
document will have indicated the character of the
royal correspondence discovered at Boghaz Keui. In
some respects it closely resembles that from Tell el-Amarna,
but it exhibits a pleasing contrast by the
complete absence of those whining petitions for gold
and presents, which bulk so largely in the earlier documents.
The Egyptian policy of doles and bribery had
brought out the worst side of the Oriental character.
The Hittite did not believe in doles, and in any case he
had not them to give; as a consequence, his correspondence
confines itself in great measure to matters of state
and high policy, and exhibits far greater dignity and
self-respect. And this applies equally, so far as we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
see, to the communications with Egypt, who had recovered
from her temporary decadence. There can be
little doubt that the royal Hittite letters, when published,
will enable us to follow the political movements of the
period in even greater detail.</p>

<p>One other act of Khattusil may be referred to, as it
illustrates in the religious sphere the breaking down of
international barriers which took place. A few years
after the completion of his great treaty, Khattusil
brought his daughter to Egypt, where she was married
to Rameses with great pomp and circumstance. An
intimate friendship continued to exist between the two
royal families, and when Bentresh, his sister-in-law, fell
ill in Khatti and was believed to be incurably possessed
by a devil, Rameses hastened to send his physician to
cure her.<a name="FNanchor_42_498" id="FNanchor_42_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_498" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> But his efforts proving fruitless, the Pharaoh
despatched the holy image of Khonsu, the Egyptian
Moon-god, to Cappadocia, in order to cure her. The
god duly arrived at the distant capital, and, while he
wrought with the evil spirit, it is said that the Hittite
king "stood with his soldiers and feared very greatly."<a name="FNanchor_43_499" id="FNanchor_43_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_499" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
But Khonsu was victorious, and the spirit having
departed in peace to the place whence he came, there
was great rejoicing. The episode forms an interesting
parallel to Ishtar's journey into Egypt in the reign of
Amenhetep III.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the son and grandson of
Khattusil, Dudkhalia and Arnuanta, carried on their
father's policy of friendliness towards Babylon, who had
no reason politically to resent the intrusion of Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
influence at Khatti.<a name="FNanchor_44_500" id="FNanchor_44_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_500" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But Arnuanta is the last king
of Khatti whose name has been recovered, and it is
certain that in the following century the invasion of
Anatolia by the Phrygians and the Muski put an end
to Hittite power in Cappadocia. The Hittites were
pressed southward through the passes, and they continued
to wield a diminished political influence in
Northern Syria. Meanwhile Assyria profited by their
downfall and disappearance in the north. She had
already expanded at the expense of Mitanni, and now
that this second check upon her was removed, the
balance of power ceased to be maintained in Western
Asia. Babylon's history from this time forward is in
great part moulded by her relations with the northern
kingdom. Even at the time of the later Hittite kings
she failed to maintain her frontier from Assyrian encroachment,
and the capital itself was soon to fall. We
are able to follow the course of these events in some
detail, as, with the reign of Kara-indash I., the earliest
of Amen-hetep III.'s correspondents,<a name="FNanchor_45_501" id="FNanchor_45_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_501" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> our sources of information

<p>In the long period between Agum-kakrime<a name="FNanchor_47_503" id="FNanchor_47_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_503" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and

and it is possible that a son of the latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Meli-Shipak, succeeded his father on the throne.<a name="FNanchor_50_506" id="FNanchor_50_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_506" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> We
know nothing of Babylon's relations to Assyria at this
time, and our first glimpse of their long struggle for
supremacy is in the reign of Kara-indash, who is recorded
to have made a friendly agreement with Ashur-rim-nishêshu
with regard to their common boundary.<a name="FNanchor_51_507" id="FNanchor_51_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_507" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> That
such an agreement should have been drawn up is in
itself evidence of friction, and it is not surprising that a
generation or so later Burna-Buriash, the correspondent
of Amen-hetep III., should have found it necessary to
conclude a similar treaty with Puzur-Ashur, the contemporary
Assyrian king.<a name="FNanchor_52_508" id="FNanchor_52_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_508" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> We may regard these agreements
as marking the beginning of the first phase in Babylon's
subsequent dealings with Assyria, which closes with
friendly agreements of a like character at the time of the
Fourth Babylonian dynasty. During the intervening
period of some three centuries friendly relations
were constantly interrupted by armed conflicts, which
generally resulted in a rectification of the frontier to
Babylon's disadvantage. On only one occasion was she
victorious in battle, and twice during the period the
capital itself was taken. But Assyria was not yet
strong enough to dominate the southern kingdom for
any length of time, and at the close of the period
Babylon may still be regarded as in occupation of a
great part of her former territory, but with sorely
diminished prestige.</p>

<p>To appreciate the motives which impelled Assyria
from time to time to intervene in Babylonian politics,
and to attempt spasmodically a southward expansion, it
would be necessary to trace out her own history, and
note the manner in which her ambition in other quarters
reacted upon her policy in the south. As that would
be out of place in the present volume, it will suffice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
here to summarize events so far as Babylon was affected.
The friendly attitude of Puzur-Ashur to Burna-Buriash
was maintained by the more powerful Assyrian king
Ashur-uballit, who cemented an alliance between the
two countries by giving Burna-Buriash his daughter
Muballitat-Sherûa in marriage. On the death of Burna-Buriash,
his son Kara-indash II., who was Ashur-uballit's
grandson, ascended the throne, and it was probably due
to his Assyrian sympathies that the Kassite party in
Babylon revolted, slew him and set Nazi-bugash in his
place. Ashur-uballit invaded Babylonia, and having
taken vengeance on Nazi-bugash, put Kurigalzu III.,
another son of Burna-Buriash, upon the throne.<a name="FNanchor_53_509" id="FNanchor_53_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_509" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> But
the young Kurigalzu did not fulfil the expectations of
his Assyrian relatives, for after Ashur-uballit's death he
took the initiative against Assyria,<a name="FNanchor_54_510" id="FNanchor_54_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_510" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and was defeated at
Sugagi on the Zabzallat by Enlil-nirari, to whom he was
obliged to cede territory. A further extension of
Assyrian territory was secured by Adad-nirari I., when
he defeated Kurigalzu's son and successor, Nazi-maruttash,
at Kâr-Ishtar in the frontier district of Akarsallu.<a name="FNanchor_55_511" id="FNanchor_55_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_511" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
We have already seen from the Boghaz Keui correspondence
how the Hittite Empire and Babylon were
drawn together at this time by dread of their common
foe, doubtless in consequence of the aggressive policy
of Shalmaneser I. We do not know whether Kadashman-Enlil
II. followed the promptings of Khattusil,
and it is not until the reign of Kashtiliash II.<a name="FNanchor_56_512" id="FNanchor_56_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_512" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> that we
have record of fresh conflicts. Then it was that Babylon
suffered her first serious disaster at Assyrian hands. Up
to this time we have seen that two Assyrian kings had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
defeated Babylonian armies, and had exacted cessions of
territory as the result of their victories. Tukulti-Ninib
I. was only following in their steps when he in turn
defeated Kashtiliash. But his achievement differed
from theirs in degree, for he succeeded in capturing
Babylon itself, deported the Babylonian king, and,
instead of merely acquiring a fresh strip of territory, he
subdued Karduniash<a name="FNanchor_57_513" id="FNanchor_57_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_513" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and administered it as a province
of his kingdom till his death.<a name="FNanchor_58_514" id="FNanchor_58_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_514" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The revolts which closed
Tukulti-Ninib's reign and life<a name="FNanchor_59_515" id="FNanchor_59_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_515" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> were soon followed by
Babylon's only successful campaign against Assyria.</p>

<p>Adad-shum-usur, who owed his throne to a revolt of
the Kassite nobles against the Assyrian domination,
restored the fortunes of his country for a time. He
defeated and slew Enlil-kudur-usur in battle, and, when
the Assyrians retreated, he followed them up and
fought a battle before Ashur. This successful reassertion
of Babylon's initiative was maintained by his direct
descendants Meli-Shipak II. and Marduk-aplu-iddina, or
Merodach-baladan I.; and the kudurru-records of their
reigns, which have been recovered, have thrown an
interesting light on the internal conditions of the
country during the later Kassite period. But Assyria
once again asserted herself under Ashur-dân I., who
defeated Zamama-shum-iddin and succeeded in recovering
her lost frontier provinces.<a name="FNanchor_60_516" id="FNanchor_60_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_516" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The Kassite dynasty
did not long survive this defeat, although it received its
death-blow from another quarter. Shutruk-Nakhkhunte,
the Elamite king, invaded Babylonia, defeated and
slew Zamama-shum-iddin, and, aided by son Kutir-Nakhkhunte,
he sacked Sippar and carried away much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
spoil to Elam. The name of the last Kassite ruler, who
reigned for only three years, is broken in the Kings'
List, but it is possible that we may restore it as Bêlnadin-akhi,<a name="FNanchor_61_517" id="FNanchor_61_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_517" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
whom Nebuchadnezzar I. mentions after
referring to the invasion which cost Zamama-shum-iddin
his life. Whether we accept the identification or not,
we may certainly connect the fall of the Kassite Dynasty
with aggression on the part of Elam, such as so often
before had changed the course of Babylonian politics.</p>

<p>Apart from the tablets of the Kassite period discovered
at Nippur,<a name="FNanchor_62_518" id="FNanchor_62_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_518" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> our principal source of information
on economic conditions in Babylonia at this time is to
be found in the kudurru-inscriptions, or boundary-stones,
to which reference has already been made.<a name="FNanchor_63_519" id="FNanchor_63_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_519" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
The word <i>kudurru</i> may be rendered accurately enough
as "boundary-stone," for the texts are engraved on
conical blocks or boulders of stone; and there is little
doubt that many of the earlier stones must have been
set up on landed estates, whose limits and ownership
they were intended to define and commemorate. Even
at a time when the stone itself had ceased to be employed
to mark the boundary and was preserved in the
owner's house, or in the temple of his god, as a charter
or title-deed to which he could appeal in case of need,
the text preserved its old formulas setting out the limits
and orientation of the plot of land to which it referred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
The importance of these records is considerable, not
only in their legal and religious aspects, but also from a
historical point of view. Apart from the references to
Babylonian kings and to historical events, which they
contain, they form in many cases the only documents
of their period which have come down to us. They
thus serve to bridge the gap in our knowledge of
Euphratean civilization between the Kassite epoch and
that of the Neo-Babylonian kings; and, while they
illustrate the development which gradually took place
in Babylonian law and custom, they prove the continuity
of culture during times of great political
change.<a name="FNanchor_64_520" id="FNanchor_64_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_520" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The kudurru or boundary-stone had its origin under
the Kassite kings, and, while at first recording, or confirming,
a royal grant of land to an important official or
servant of the king, its aim was undoubtedly to place
the newly acquired rights of the owner under the protection
of the gods. A series of curses, regularly
appended to the legal record, was directed against any
interference with the owner's rights, which were also
placed under the protection of a number of deities whose
symbols were engraved upon the blank spaces of the
stone. It has been suggested that the idea of placing
property under divine protection was not entirely an
innovation of the Kassites. It is true that the foundation-cones
of the early Sumerian patesi Entemena may
well have ended with elaborate curses intended to preserve
a frontier-ditch from violation.<a name="FNanchor_65_521" id="FNanchor_65_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_521" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> But the cones
themselves, and the stele from which they were copied,
were intended to protect a national frontier, not the
boundaries of private property. Gate-sockets, too, have
been treated as closely related to boundary-stones, on
the ground that the threshold of a temple might be regarded
as its boundary.<a name="FNanchor_66_522" id="FNanchor_66_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_522" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> But the main object of the
gate-socket was to support the temple-gate, and its
prominent position and the durable nature of its material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
no doubt suggested its employment as a suitable place
for a commemorative inscription. The peculiarity of
the boundary-stone is that, by both curse and sculptured
emblem, it invokes divine protection upon private
property and the rights of private individuals.</p>

<p>In the age of Hammurabi we have no evidence of
such a practice, and the Obelisk of Manishtusu,<a name="FNanchor_67_523" id="FNanchor_67_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_523" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> the far
earlier Semitic king of Akkad, which records his extensive
purchases of land in Northern Babylonia, is
without the protection of imprecatory clauses or symbols
of the gods. The suggestion is thus extremely probable
that the custom of protecting private property in this
way arose at a time when the authority of the law was
not sufficiently powerful to guarantee respect for the
property of private individuals.<a name="FNanchor_68_524" id="FNanchor_68_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_524" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> This would specially
apply to grants of land to favoured officials settled
among a hostile population, especially if no adequate
payment for the property had been made by the Kassite
king. The disorder and confusion which followed the
fall of the First Dynasty must have been renewed during
the Kassite conquest of the country, and the absence of
any feeling of public security would account for the
general adoption of such a practice as placing land in
private possession under the protection of the gods.</p>

<p>The use of stone stelæ for this purpose may well
have been suggested by a Kassite custom; for in the
mountains of Western Persia, the recent home of the
Kassite tribes before their conquest of the river-plain,
stones had probably been used to mark the limits of
their fields, and these may well have borne short inscriptions
giving the owner's name and title.<a name="FNanchor_69_525" id="FNanchor_69_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_525" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The employment
of curses to secure divine protection was undoubtedly
of Babylonian, and ultimately of Sumerian
origin, but the idea of placing symbols of the gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
upon the stone was probably Kassite.<a name="FNanchor_70_526" id="FNanchor_70_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_526" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Moreover, the
kudurru was not the original title-deed recording the
acquisition of the land to which it refers. As in
the earlier Babylonian periods, clay tablets continued to
be employed for this purpose, and they received the
impression of the royal seal as evidence of the king's
sanction and authority. The text of the tablet, generally
with the list of witnesses, was later on recopied by the
engraver upon the stone, and the curses and symbols
were added.<a name="FNanchor_71_527" id="FNanchor_71_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_527" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>A boundary-stone was sometimes employed to commemorate
a confirmation of title, and, like many modern
legal documents, it recited the previous history of the
property during a long period extending over several
reigns. But the majority of the stones recovered commemorate
original grants of land made by the king to
a relative, or to one of his adherents in return for some
special service. Perhaps the finest of this class of charters
is that in which Meli-Shipak makes a grant of certain
property in Bît-Pir-Shadû-rabû, near the old city of
Akkad or Agade and the Kassite town Dûr-Kurigalzu,
to his son Merodach-baladan I., who afterwards succeeded
him upon the throne.<a name="FNanchor_72_528" id="FNanchor_72_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_528" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> After giving the size
and situation of the estates, and the names of the high
officials who had been entrusted with the duty of drawing
up the survey, the text defines the privileges granted
to Merodach-baladan along with the land. As some of
these throw considerable light on the system of land
tenure during the Kassite period, they may be briefly
summarized.</p>

</div>

<p>The king, in conferring the ownership of the land
upon his son, freed it from all taxes and tithes, and forbade
the displacement of its ditches, limits, and boundaries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
He freed it also from the <i>corvée,</i> and enacted that none
of the people of the estate were to be requisitioned
among the gangs levied in its district for public works,
for the prevention of flood, or for the repair of the royal
canal, a section of which was maintained in working
order by the neighbouring villages of Bît-Sikkamidu
and Damiḳ-Adad. They were not liable to forced
labour on the canal-sluices, nor for building dams, nor
for digging out the canal-bed. No cultivator on the
property, whether hired or belonging to the estate, was
to be requisitioned by the local governor even under
royal authority. No levy was to be made on wood,
grass, straw, corn, or any sort of crop, on the carts and
yokes, on asses or man-servants. No one was to use
his son's irrigation-ditch, and no levy was to be made on
his water-supply even during times of drought. No one
was to mow his grass-land without his permission, and
no beasts belonging to the king or governor, which
might be assigned to the district, were to be driven over
or pastured on the estate. And, finally, he was freed
from all liability to build a road or a bridge for the
public convenience, even though the king or the
governor should give the order.</p>

<p>From these regulations it will be seen that the owner
of land in Babylonia under the later Kassite kings, unless
granted special exemption, was liable to furnish forced
labour for public works both to the state and to his local
district; he had to supply grazing and pasture for the
flocks and herds of the king and the governor, and to
pay various taxes and tithes on land, irrigation-water,
and crops. We have already noted the prevalence of
similar customs under the First Dynasty,<a name="FNanchor_73_529" id="FNanchor_73_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_529" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and it is clear
that the successive conquests to which the country had
been subjected, and its domination by a foreign race,
had not to any appreciable extent affected the life and
customs of the people nor even the general character of
the administrative system.</p>

<p>On one subject the boundary-stones throw additional
light, which is lacking at the period of the First
Dynasty, and that is the old Babylonian system of land
tenure. They suggest that the lands, which formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the subject of royal grants during the Kassite period,
were generally the property of the local <i>bîtu,</i> or tribe.<a name="FNanchor_74_530" id="FNanchor_74_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_530" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> In
certain cases the king actually purchased the land from
the <i>bîtu</i> in whose district it was situated, and, when no
consideration was given, we need merely assume that it
was requisitioned by royal authority. The primitive
system of tribal or collective proprietorship, which is
attested by the Obelisk of Manishtusu,<a name="FNanchor_75_531" id="FNanchor_75_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_531" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> undoubtedly
survived into the Kassite period, when it co-existed with
the system of private ownership, as it had doubtless done
at the time of the West-Semitic kings. The <i>bîtu</i> must
often have occupied an extensive area, split up into
separate districts or groups of villages. It had its own
head, the <i>bêl bîti,</i> and its own body of local functionaries,
who were quite distinct from the official and military
servants of the state. In fact, agricultural life in
Babylonia during the earlier periods must have presented
many points of analogy to such examples of collective
proprietorship as may be seen in the village communities
of India at the present day. As the latter system has
survived the political changes and revolutions of many
centuries, so it is probable that the tribal proprietorship
in Babylonia was slow to decay.</p>

<p>The principal factor in its disintegration was undoubtedly
the policy, pursued by the West-Semitic and
Kassite conquerors, of settling their own officers and
more powerful adherents on estates throughout the
country. Both these periods thus represent a time of
transition, during which the older system of land tenure
gradually gave way in face of the policy of private ownership,
which for purely political reasons was so strongly
encouraged by the crown. There can be no doubt that
under the West-Semitic kings, at any rate from the
time of Hammurabi onwards, the policy of confiscation
was rarely resorted to. And even the earlier rulers of
that dynasty, since they were of the same racial stock
as a large proportion of their new subjects, would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
been the more inclined to respect tribal institutions
which may have found a parallel in their land of origin.
The Kassites, on the other hand, had no such racial
associations to restrain them, and it is significant that
the kudurrus were now for the first time introduced,
with their threatening emblems of divinity and their
imprecatory clauses. At first employed to guard the
rights of private ownership, often based on high-handed
requisition by the king, they were afterwards retained
for transfers of landed property by purchase. In the
Neo-Babylonian period, when the boundary-stones recorded
long series of purchases by means of which the
larger landed estates were built up, the imprecations and
symbols had become to a great extent conventional
survivals.</p>

<p>But that period was still far distant, and the
vicissitudes the country was to pass through were not
conducive to security of tenure, whether the property
were held under private or collective ownership. We
have seen that Assyria, as early as the thirteenth century,
had succeeded in capturing and sacking Babylon, and,
according to one tradition, had ruled the city for seven
years. She was shortly to renew her attempts to subjugate
the southern kingdom; but it was Elam,
Babylon's still older foe, that brought the long and
undistinguished Kassite Dynasty to an end.</p>

concern Babylon. Two of these are drafts, or copies, of letters which Amenhetep
III. despatched to Kadashman-Enlil of Babylon (cf. Kundtzon, <i>op. cit.,</i>
pp. 60 ff., 74 ff.); three are letters received by Amen-hetep III. from the
same correspondent (<i>op. cit.,</i> pp. 66 ff., 68 ff., 72 ff.); five are letters written by
Burna-Buriash of Babylon to Amen-hetep IV. or Akhenaten (<i>op. cit.,</i> pp.
78 ff.); and one is a letter from Burna-Buriash, which may have been
addressed to Amen-hetep III. (<i>op. cit.,</i> 78 f.). We also possess a letter, from a
princess in Babylon to her lord in Egypt, on a purely domestic matter (<i>op. cit.,</i>
pp. 118 ff.), as well as long lists of presents which passed between Akhenaten
and Burna-Buriash (<i>op. cit.,</i> pp. 100 ff.); one of the letters also appears to be
a Babylonian passport for use in Canaan (see below, <a href="#Page_225">p. 225</a>, n. 3). The letters
thus fall in the reigns of two Kassite rulers, Kadashman-Enlil I. and Burna-Buriash,
but from one of Burna-Buriash's letters to Akhenaten we gather
that Amen-hetep III. had corresponded with a still earlier king in Babylon,
Kara-indash I.; for the letter begins by assuring the Pharaoh that "since the
time of Kara-indash, when their fathers had begun to correspond with one
another, they had always been good friends" (cf. Knudtzon, <i>op. cit.,</i> pp. 90 ff.).
We have recovered no letters of Kurigalzu, the father of Burna-Buriash,
though Amen-hetep III. maintained friendly relations with him (see below,
<a href="#Page_224">p. 224</a>). In a letter of Amen-hetep III. to Kadashman-Enlil reference is also
made to correspondence between the two countries in the time of Amen-hetep

represent a lion, facing any one approaching the entrance from without (cf.
Puchstein, "Boghasköi," pi. 23 f.). The figure sculptured in relief on the
inner side of the Royal Gateway (see <a href="#Page_229">p. 229</a>, <a href="#kingill229">Fig. 51</a>) preserves an interesting
feature of the best Hittite work,&mdash;an unusual combination of minute surface-adornment
with great boldness of design. The hatching and scroll-work on
the garment are only roughly indicated in the small drawing, and other
detail is omitted. Hair on the breast of the figure, for example, doubtless
regarded as a sign of strength and virility, is conventionally rendered by
series of minute overlapping curls, which form a diapered pattern traced with
the point. This can only be detected on the original stone, or in a large-size
photograph, such as that reproduced by Puchstein, <i>op. cit.,</i> pl. 19. The Royal
Gateway is in the S.E. corner of the city, near the palace and the smaller
temples. The great temple, by far the largest building on the site, lies on
the lower ground to the north.</p></div>

of Rameses and his complete miscalculation of the enemy's strength and
resources; for the Egyptians had never yet met so powerful an enemy as the
Hittites proved themselves to be. With the help of the reliefs it is possible
to follow the tactics of the opposing armies in some detail. The accompanying
inscriptions are very fragmentary, but they are supplemented by a
historical account of the battle, introducing a poem in celebration of the
valour of Rameses, preserved on a papyrus in the British Museum. For a

Mutallu but had not returned. Kadashman-Enlil had evidently written to
enquire about them, and Khattusil replies that the exorcist is dead, but that
the physician will be sent back; cf. Winckler, <i>op. cit.,</i> p. 26. Medicine at

inscription in which Nebuchadnezzar records how he turned the tables
upon Elam, he refers to a ruler, between (Zamama)-shum-iddin and himself, as
<i>(ilu)BE-nadin-akhi</i> (see Rawlinson, "Cun. Inscr. West Asia," III., pl. 38,
No. 2, and cf. Winckler, "Altorientalische Forschungen," I., pp. 534 ff.).
The divine ideogram <i>(ilu)BE</i> was read as Ea by the Babylonians and as Enlil
by the Assyrians. And the identification of the two royal names has been
called in question on the grounds that the Assyrian copy, in which Nebuchadnezzar's
text has come down to us, would have reproduced the Babylonian
orthography of its original, and that in any case it is doubtful whether Enlil,
like Marduk, ever bore the synonymous title of Bêl (cf. Thureau-Dangin,
"Journ. Asiat.," XI., p. 132 f.). If we reject the identification, we should
read the name of the last king of the Kassite Dynasty as Ea-nadin-[....],
and regard Bêl-nadin-akhi as probably the second or third ruler of the Fourth
Dynasty.</p></div>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h5>


<h4>THE LATER DYNASTIES AND THE ASSYRIAN DOMINATION</h4>


<p>The historian of ancient Babylonia has reason to
be grateful to Shutruk-Nakhkhunte and his son
for their raids into the Euphrates valley, since
certain of the monuments they carried off as spoil have
been preserved in the mounds of Susa, until the French
expedition brought them again to light. Thanks to
Babylon's misfortunes at this time, we have recovered
some of her finest memorials, including the famous Stele
of Narâm-Sin, Hammurabi's Code of Laws, and an important
series of the Kassite kudurrus, or boundary-stones,
which, as we have seen, throw considerable light
upon the economic condition of the country. These
doubtless represent but a small proportion of the booty
secured by Elam at this period, but they suffice to show
the manner in which the great Babylonian cities were
denuded of their treasures. Under the earlier kings of
the Fourth Dynasty it would seem that Elam continued
to be a menace, and it was not until the reign of
Nebuchadnezzar I. that the land was freed from further
danger of Elamite invasion. We possess two interesting
memorials of his successful campaigns, during which
he not only regained his own territories, but carried the
war into the enemy's country. One is a charter of
privileges, which the king conferred upon Ritti-Marduk,
the Captain of his chariots, for signal service against
Elam. The text is engraved on a block of calcareous
limestone, and on one side of it are a series of divine
symbols, sculptured in high relief, in order to place the
record under the protection of the gods, in accordance
with the custom introduced during the Kassite period.
The campaign in Elam which furnished the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
for the charter was undertaken, according to the text,<a name="FNanchor_1_532" id="FNanchor_1_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_532" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
with the object of "avenging Akkad," that is to say, in
retaliation for the Elamite raids in Northern Babylonia.
The campaign was conducted from the frontier city of
Dêr, or Dûr-ilu, and, as it was carried out in the summer,
the Babylonian army suffered considerably on the march.
The heat of the sun was so great that, in the words of
the record, the axe burned like fire, the roads scorched
like flame, and through the lack of drinking-water "the
vigour of the great horses failed, and the legs of the
strong man turned aside." Ritti-Marduk, as Captain of
the chariots, encouraged the troops by his example, and
eventually brought them to the Euheus, where they
gave battle to the Elamite confederation which had been
summoned to oppose them.</p>

<p>The record describes the subsequent battle in vivid
phraseology. "The kings took their stand round about
and offered battle. Fire was kindled in their midst;
by their dust was the face of the sun darkened. The
hurricane sweeps along, the storm rages; in the storm
of their battle the warrior in the chariot perceives not
the companion at his side." Here again Ritti-Marduk
did good service by leading the attack. "He turned
evil against the King of Elam, so that destruction overtook
him; King Nebuchadnezzar triumphed, he captured
the land of Elam, he plundered its possessions." On
his return from the campaign Nebuchadnezzar granted
the charter to Ritti-Marduk, freeing the towns and
villages of Bît-Karziabku, of which he was the head-man,
from the jurisdiction of the neighbouring town of
Namar. In addition to freedom from all taxation and
the <i>corvée,</i> the privileges secured the inhabitants from
liability to arrest by imperial soldiers stationed in the
district, and forbade the billeting of such troops upon
them. This portion of the text affords an interesting
glimpse of the military organization of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The second memorial too has a bearing on this war,
since it exhibits Nebuchadnezzar as a patron of Elamite
refugees. It is a copy of a deed recording a grant of
land and privileges to Shamfia and his son Shamfiia,
priests of the Elamite god Rîa, who, in fear of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Elamite king, fled from their own country and secured
Nebuchadnezzar's protection. The text states that,
when the king undertook an expedition on their behalf,
they accompanied him and brought back the statue of
the god Rîa, whose cult Nebuchadnezzar inaugurated
in the Babylonian city of Khuṣṣi, after he had introduced
the foreign god into Babylon at the Feast of the New
Year. The deed records the grant of five estates to

the land in future from all liability to taxation and
forced labour.<a name="FNanchor_2_533" id="FNanchor_2_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_533" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Though Nebuchadnezzar restored the fortunes of
his country, he was not the founder of his dynasty,<a name="FNanchor_3_534" id="FNanchor_3_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_534" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Of his three predecessors, the name of one may now
be restored as Marduk-shapik-zêrim. His name has
been read on a kudurru-fragment in the Yale Collection,
which is dated in the eighth year of Marduk-nadin-akhê,
and refers to the twelfth year of Marduk-shapik-zêrim.<a name="FNanchor_4_535" id="FNanchor_4_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_535" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
That he cannot be identified with Marduk-shapik-zêr-mâti
is certain, since we know from the
"Synchronistic History" that the latter succeeded
Marduk-nadin-akhê upon the throne of Babylon, the
one being the contemporary of Tiglath-pileser I., the
other of his son Ashur-bêl-kala.<a name="FNanchor_5_536" id="FNanchor_5_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_536" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The close sequence
of the reigns of Nebuchadnezzar I., Enlil-nadin-apli,
and Marduk-nadin-akhê has long been recognized from
the occurrence of the same officials on legal documents
of the period.<a name="FNanchor_6_537" id="FNanchor_6_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_537" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> We must therefore place the newly
recovered ruler in the gap before Nebuchadnezzar I.;
he must be one of the first three kings of the dynasty,
possibly its founder, whose name in the Kings' List
begins with the divine title Marduk, and who ruled
for seventeen years according to the same authority.
Another of these missing rulers may perhaps be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
restored as Ea-nadin-[....], if the royal name in the
broken inscription of Nebuchadnezzar I., to which
reference has already been made,<a name="FNanchor_7_538" id="FNanchor_7_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_538" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is to be read in
that way and not identified as that of the last member
of the Kassite Dynasty. During the earlier years of
the Dynasty of Isin Babylonia must have been subject
to further Elamite aggression, and portions of the
country may for a time have acknowledged the suzerainty
of her rulers.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar's successes against Elam and the
neighbouring district of Lulubu<a name="FNanchor_8_539" id="FNanchor_8_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_539" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> no doubt enabled him to
offer a more vigorous defence of his northern frontier;
and, when Ashur-rêsh-ishi attempted an invasion of
Babylonian territory, he not only drove the Assyrians
back, but followed them up and laid siege to the frontier
fortress of Zanki. But Ashur-rêsh-ishi forced him to
raise the siege and burn his siege-train; and, on Nebuchadnezzar's
return with reinforcements, the Babylonian
army suffered a further defeat, losing its fortified camp
together with Karashtu, the general in command of the
army, who was taken to Assyria as a prisoner of war.
Babylon thus proved that, though strong enough to
recover and maintain her independence, she was incapable
of a vigorous offensive on a large scale. It is
true that Nebuchadnezzar claimed among his titles
that of "Conqueror of Amurru,"<a name="FNanchor_9_540" id="FNanchor_9_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_540" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but it is doubtful
whether we should regard the term as implying
more than a raid into the region of the middle
Euphrates.<a name="FNanchor_10_541" id="FNanchor_10_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_541" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>That within her own borders Babylon maintained
an effective administration is clear from a boundary-stone
of the period of Nebuchadnezzar's successor, Enlil-nadin-apli,
recording a grant of land in the district of
Edina in Southern Babylonia by E-anna-shum-iddina,
a governor of the Sea-Country, who administered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
district under the Babylonian king and owed his appointment
to him.<a name="FNanchor_11_542" id="FNanchor_11_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_542" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But in the reign of Marduk-nadin-akhê,
she was to suffer her second great defeat at the hands
of Assyria. She fought two campaigns with Tiglath-pileser
I., in the latter part of his reign, after his
successes in the North and West.<a name="FNanchor_12_543" id="FNanchor_12_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_543" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In the first she
met with some success,<a name="FNanchor_13_544" id="FNanchor_13_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_544" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but on the second occasion
Tiglath-pileser completely reversed its result, and followed
up his victory by the capture of Babylon itself
with other of the great northern cities, Dûr-Kurigalzu,
Sippar of Shamash, Sippar of Anunitum, and Opis.
But Assyria did not then attempt a permanent occupation,
for we find Tiglath-pileser's son, Ashur-bêl-kala,
on friendly terms with Marduk-shapik-zêr-mâti; and
when the latter, after a prosperous reign,<a name="FNanchor_14_545" id="FNanchor_14_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_545" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> lost his throne
to the Aramean usurper Adad-aplu-iddina,<a name="FNanchor_15_546" id="FNanchor_15_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_546" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> he further
strengthened the alliance by contracting a marriage with
the new king's daughter.<a name="FNanchor_16_547" id="FNanchor_16_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_547" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Thus closed the first phase of Babylon's relations
with the growing Assyrian power. A state of alternate
conflict and temporary truce had been maintained
between them for some three centuries, and now for
more than half a century the internal condition of
both countries was such as to put an end to any policy
of aggression. The cause of Babylon's decline was the
overrunning of the country by the Sutû, semi-nomad
Semitic tribes from beyond the Euphrates,<a name="FNanchor_17_548" id="FNanchor_17_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_548" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> who made
their first descent during Adad-aplu-iddina's later years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
and, according to a Neo-Babylonian chronicle, carried
off with them the spoil of Sumer and Akkad. This
was probably the first of many raids, and we may see
evidence of the unsettled condition of the country in the
ephemeral Babylonian dynasties, which followed one
another in quick succession.<a name="FNanchor_18_549" id="FNanchor_18_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_549" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The later ruler, Nabû-aplu-iddina, when recording
his rebuilding of the great temple of the Sun-god at
Sippar,<a name="FNanchor_19_550" id="FNanchor_19_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_550" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> has left us some details of this troubled time;
and the facts he relates of one of the great cities of
Akkad may be regarded as typical of the general condition
of the country. The temple had been wrecked
by the Sutû, doubtless at the time of Adad-aplu-iddina,
and it was not until the reign of Simmash-Shipak, who
came from the Country of the Sea and founded the
Fifth Dynasty,<a name="FNanchor_20_551" id="FNanchor_20_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_551" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> that any attempt was made to reestablish
the interrupted service of the deity. His
successor, Ea-mukîn-zêr, did not retain the throne for
more than five months, and in the reign of Kashshûnadin-akhi,
with whom the dynasty closed, the country
suffered further misfortunes, the general distress, occasioned
by raids and civil disturbance, being increased by
famine. Thus the service of the temple again suffered,
until under E-ulmash-shakin-shum of Bît-Bazi, who
founded the Sixth Dynasty, a partial re-endowment
of the temple took place. But its half ruinous condition
continued to attest the poverty of the country
and of its rulers, until the more prosperous times of
Nabû-aplu-iddina. E-ulmash-shakin-shum was succeeded
by two members of his own house, Ninib-kudur-usur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and Shilanum-Shuḳamuna; but they reigned between
them less than four years, and the throne then passed
for six years to an Elamite,<a name="FNanchor_21_552" id="FNanchor_21_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_552" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> whose rule is regarded by
the later chroniclers as having constituted in itself the
Seventh Babylonian Dynasty.</p>

<p>A stable government was once more established in
Babylonia by Nabû-mukîn-apli, the founder of the Eighth
Dynasty,<a name="FNanchor_22_553" id="FNanchor_22_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_553" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> though even in his reign Aramean tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
continued to give trouble, holding the Euphrates in the
neighbourhood of Babylon and Borsippa, cutting communications,
and raiding the country-side. On one
occasion they captured the Ferry-Gate of Kâr-bêlmâtâti
and prevented the king from holding the New
Year's Festival, as the statue of the god Nabû could
not be transported across the river to Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_23_554" id="FNanchor_23_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_554" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> A
rude portrait of this monarch is preserved on a boundary-stone
of his reign, on which he is represented giving the
royal sanction to the transfer of an estate in the district
of Sha-mamîtu; and it may be added that considerable
friction subsequently took place, with regard to the
validity of the title, between the original owner Arad-Sibitti
and his son-in-law, a jewel-worker named
Burusha.<a name="FNanchor_24_555" id="FNanchor_24_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_555" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The coarse style of the engraving is probably
to be explained by the fact of its provincial origin,
though there can be little doubt that the standard of
Babylonian art had been adversely affected by the
internal condition of the country during the preceding
period.</p>

<p>It was at the time of the Eighth Dynasty that the
renaissance of Assyria took place, which culminated in
the victories of that ruthless conqueror Ashur-nasir-pal
and of his son Shalmaneser III. Its effect was first felt
in Babylon in the reign of Shamash-mudammik, who
suffered a serious defeat in the neighbourhood of Mt.
Ialman at the hands of Adad-nirari III., Ashur-nasir-pal's
grandfather. Against Nabû-shum-ishkun I., the
murderer and successor of Shamash-mudammik, Adad-nirari
secured another victory, several Babylonian cities
with much spoil falling into his hands. But we subsequently
find him on friendly terms with Babylon, and
allying himself with Nabû-shum-ishkun, or possibly
with his successor, each monarch marrying the others
daughter.<a name="FNanchor_25_556" id="FNanchor_25_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_556" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> His son Tukulti-Ninib II. of Assyria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
profiting by the renewed sense of security from attack
upon his southern border, began to make tentative
efforts at expanding westwards into Mesopotamia. But
it was reserved for Ashur-nasir-pal, his son, to cross the
Euphrates and lead Assyrian armies once more into
Syrian territory. After securing his frontier to the east
and north of Assyria, Ashur-nasir-pal turned his attention
to the west. The Aramean states of Bît-Khadippi
and Bît-Adini, both on the left bank of the Euphrates,
fell before his onslaught. Then crossing the Euphrates
on rafts of skins, he received the submission of Sangar
of Carchemish, and marched in triumph through Syria
to the coast.</p>

<p>Babylon naturally viewed this encroachment on the
Euphrates route to the west as a danger to her commercial
connexions, and it is not surprising that Nabû-aplu-iddina
should have attempted to oppose Ashur-nasir-pal's
advance by allying himself with Shadudu of
Sukhi.<a name="FNanchor_26_557" id="FNanchor_26_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_557" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But the armed forces he sent to support the
people of Sukhi in their resistance were quite unable to
withstand the Assyrian onslaught, and his brother
Sabdanu and Bêl-aplu-iddin, the Babylonian leader, fell
into Ashur-nasir-pal's hands. In recording his victory
the Assyrian king refers to the Babylonians as the
Kassites,<a name="FNanchor_27_558" id="FNanchor_27_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_558" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> a striking tribute to the fame of the foreign
dynasty which had ended more than three centuries
before. Nabû-aplu-iddina evidently realized the futility
of attempting further opposition to Assyrian aims, and
he was glad to establish relations of a friendly character,
which he continued in the reign of Shalmaneser. He
attempted to forget the failure of his military expedition
by repairing the damage inflicted during the numerous
Aramean raids upon the ancient cult-centres of
Babylonia.</p>

with much ceremony re-established the ritual and offerings
for the god, placing them under the control of
Nabû-nadin-shum, a descendant of the former priest
E-kur-shum-ushabshi, whom Simmash-Shipak had installed
at Sippar. The sculptured scene on the stone
memorial-tablet, which records the re-endowment of the
temple, represents Nabû-aplu-iddina being led by the

<p>The skill of the Babylonian
craftsmen at this period is also
attested by a cylinder of lapis-lazuli,
engraved in low relief
with a figure of Marduk and
his dragon, which was dedicated
in E-sagila at Babylon
by Marduk-zakir-shum, the
son and successor of Nabû-aplu-iddina.
It was originally
coated with gold, and the
design and execution of the
figure may be compared with
those of the Sun-god Tablet,
as an additional example of the decorative character of
Babylonian stone-engraving in the ninth century.</p>

<p>It was in Marduk-zakir-shum's reign that Assyria
capped her conquests of this period by becoming the
suzerain of Babylon. Under Ashur-naṣir-pal and Shalmaneser
the military organization of the country had
been renewed, and both made effective use of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
extraordinarily efficient armies. Ashur-nasir-pal's policy
was one of annihilation, and the speed with which he
struck ensured his success. Thus when he crossed the
Euphrates after taking Carchemish, the king of
Damascus, the most powerful and important state in
Syria, made no attempt to oppose him or to organize a
defence. He had evidently been taken by surprise.</p>

But Syria then learned her lesson, and at the battle
of Karkar in 854 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Shalmaneser found himself
opposed by a confederation of the northern kings, and,
though he eventually succeeded in ravaging the territory
of Damascus, the city itself held out. In fact, the stubborn
resistance of Damascus prevented any further
attempt on Assyria's part at this period to penetrate
further into Southern Syria and Palestine. So Shalmaneser
had to content himself with marching northwards
across Mt. Amanus, subjugating Cilicia and
exacting tribute from districts north of the Taurus.
He also conducted a successful campaign in Armenia,
from which quarter one of Assyria's most powerful
enemies was about to arise. But it was in Babylonia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
that he secured his principal political success. He has
left us a pictorial record of his campaigns on the bronze

<p>The occasion for Shalmaneser's intervention in Babylonian
affairs was furnished by internal dissension.<a name="FNanchor_29_560" id="FNanchor_29_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_560" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> When
Marduk-bêl-usâte, the brother of Marduk-zakir-shum,
revolted, and divided the country into two armed camps,
Shalmaneser readily responded to the latter's appeal
for help, and marching southwards succeeded in defeating
the rebels and in ravaging the districts under their control.
On a second expedition in the following year he
completed his work by slaying Marduk-bel-usâte in
battle, and he was then acknowledged by Marduk-zakir-shum
as his suzerain. In this capacity he toured
through the principal cities of Akkad, offering sacrifices
in the famous temples of Cuthah, Babylon, and Borsippa.
He also led his army into Chaldea, and, after storming
its frontier fortress of Bakâni, received the submission
of its ruler, Adini, and heavy tribute from him and from
Iakin, the Chaldean king of the Sea-Country further to
the south. In his representation of the campaign Shalmaneser
is portrayed marching through the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>

<p>But Babylon did not long endure the position of a
vassal state, and Shalmaneser's son and successor.
Shamshi-Adad IV., attempted her reconquest, plundering
many cities before he met with serious opposition.
Marduk-balâtsu-ikbi, the Babylonian king, had meanwhile
collected his forces, which included armed levies
from Elam, Chaldea, and other districts. The two
armies met near the city of Dûr-Papsukal, the Babylonians
were totally defeated, and a rich booty fell to
their conqueror. During a subsequent interregnum
Erba-Marduk, the son of Marduk-shakin-shum, secured
the throne, owing his election to his success in driving
Aramean raiders from the cultivated fields of Babylon
and Borsippa.<a name="FNanchor_30_561" id="FNanchor_30_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_561" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> But he did not reign for long, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Babylon continued to give trouble to Assyria, Adad-nirari
IV., the successor of Shamshi-Adad, again subjugated
a considerable portion of the country, carrying
away Bau-akhi-iddina, the Babylonian king, as a captive
to Assyria, together with the treasures of his palace.<a name="FNanchor_31_562" id="FNanchor_31_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_562" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>During the following half-century our knowledge
of Babylonian affairs is a blank, and we have not as
yet recovered even the names of the last members
of the Eighth Dynasty. This epoch corresponds to
a period of weakness and inaction in the northern
kingdom, such as more than once before had followed
a forward movement on her part. The expansion of
Assyria, in fact, took place in a series of successive
waves, and when one had spent itself, a recoil preceded
the next advance. The principal cause of her contraction,
after the brilliant reigns of Shalmaneser III.
and his father, may undoubtedly be traced to the rise
of a new power in the mountains of Armenia. From
their capital on the shore of Lake Van, the Urartians
marched southward and menaced the northern frontier
of Assyria itself. Her kings could no longer dream of
further adventures in the West, which would leave their
home territory at the mercy of this new foe. Urartu
became now the principal drag on Assyria's ambitions,
a part which was afterwards so effectively played by
Elam in alliance with Babylon.</p>

<p>It is to this period we may probably assign an interesting
provincial monument, discovered in Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_32_563" id="FNanchor_32_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_563" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
which illustrates the independent position enjoyed by
the rulers of local districts at a time when the central
control of either kingdom, and particularly of Assyria,
was relaxed. The monument commemorates the principal
achievements of Shamash-rêsh-usur, governor of
the lands of Sukhi and Mari on the middle Euphrates.<a name="FNanchor_33_564" id="FNanchor_33_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_564" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
He may have owed his appointment to Assyria, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
he speaks like a reigning monarch and dates the record
in his thirteenth year.</p>

<p class="caption">(After a photo, by Weissbach.)</p>
</div>

<p>On it he records his suppression
of a revolt of the Tu'mânu tribe, who threatened his
capital Ribanish, while he was holding festival in the
neighbouring town of Baka. But he attacked them
with the people who were with him, slew three hundred
and fifty of them, and the rest submitted. He also
records how he dug out the Sukhi Canal, when it had
silted up, and how he planted palm-trees in his palace at
Ribanish. But his most notable act, according to his
own account, was the introduction of bees into Sukhi,
which his improved irrigation of the district doubtless
rendered possible. "Bees which collect honey," he tells
us, "which no man had seen since the time of my
fathers and forefathers, nor had brought to the land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Sukhi, I brought down from the mountains of the
Khabkha-tribe and I put them in the garden of
Gabbari-ibni." The text closes with an interesting
little note upon the bees: "They collect honey and
wax. The preparing of honey and wax I understand,
and the gardeners understand it." And he adds that
in days to come a ruler will ask the elders of his land,
"Is it true that Shamash-rêsh-usur, governor of Sukhi,
brought honey-bees into the land of Sukhi?" The
monument may well have been carried to Babylon by
Nebuchadnezzar II., when he incorporated the district
within his empire.</p>

<p>The subsequent period shows a gradual tightening
of Assyria's grasp upon the southern kingdom, varied
by comparatively ineffective struggles and revolts on
Babylon's part to avoid her loss of independence. The
temporary decline of Assyrian power enabled Babylon
for a time to regain something of her former position
under Nabû-shum-ishkun II., an early king of the Ninth
Dynasty, and his successor Nabonassar. But the military
revolt in Assyria, which in 745 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> placed Tiglath-pileser
IV. upon the throne,<a name="FNanchor_34_565" id="FNanchor_34_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_565" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> put a speedy end to
Babylon's hopes of any permanent recovery of power.
His accession marks the beginning of the last period of
Assyrian expansion, and the administrative policy he
inaugurated justifies us in ascribing the term "empire"
to the area conquered by him, and his successors, in the
last half of the eighth and the first half of the seventh
centuries <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> But it was an empire which carried in
itself from the outset the seeds of decay. It was based
on a policy of deportation, Assyria's final answer to her
pressing problem of how to administer the wide areas
she annexed. Former Assyrian kings had carried away
the conquered into slavery, but Tiglath-pileser IV.
inaugurated a regular transference of nations. The
policy certainly effected its immediate object: it kept
the subject provinces quiet. But as a permanent method
of administration it was bound to be a failure. While
destroying patriotism and love of country, it put an end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
at the same time to all incentives to labour. The subject
country's accumulated wealth had already been
drained for the benefit of Assyrian coffers; and in the
hands of its half-starved colonists it was not likely to
prove a permanent source of strength, or of wealth, to
its suzerain.</p>

<p>Tiglath-pileser's first object, before launching his
armies to the north and west, was to secure his
southern frontier, and this he effected by invading
Babylonia and forcing from Nabonassar an acknowledgment
of Assyrian control. During the campaign
he overran the northern districts, and applied his policy
of deportation by carrying away many of their inhabitants.
The distress in the country, due to the Assyrian
inroads, was aggravated by internal dissension. Sippar
repudiated Nabonassar's authority, and the revolt was
subdued only after a siege of the city.<a name="FNanchor_35_566" id="FNanchor_35_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_566" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The Ninth
Dynasty ended with the country in confusion; for
Nabû-nadin-zêr, Nabopolassar's son, after a reign of
only two years, was slain in a revolt by Nabû-shum-ukin,
the governor of a province.<a name="FNanchor_36_567" id="FNanchor_36_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_567" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The dynasty soon came to
an end after the latter's accession. He had not enjoyed
his position for more than a month, when the kingdom
again changed hands, and Nabû-mukîn-zêr secured the
throne.</p>

<p>From the fall of the Ninth Dynasty, until the rise of
the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonia was completely
overshadowed by the power of Assyria. She became
merely a subject province of the empire, and her Tenth
Dynasty is mainly composed of Assyrian rulers or
their nominees. Nabû-mukîn-zêr had reigned only
three years when Tiglath-pileser again invaded Babylonia,
took him captive, and ascended the throne of
Babylon, where he ruled under his name of Pulu.<a name="FNanchor_37_568" id="FNanchor_37_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_568" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
On his death, which occurred two years later, he was
succeeded by Shalmaneser V., who, as suzerain of
Babylon, adopted the name of Ululai. But Babylonia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
soon demonstrated her power of hindering Assyrian
plans, for, after the elose of Shalmaneser's reign, when
Sargon's army had secured the capture of Samaria, he
was obliged to recall his forces from the West by the
menace of his southern province. Merodach-baladan, a
Chaldean chief of Bît-Iakin<a name="FNanchor_38_569" id="FNanchor_38_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_569" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> at the head of the Persian
Gulf, now laid claim to the throne of Babylon. By
himself he would not have been formidable to Assyria,
but he was backed by an unexpected and dangerous
ally. Elam had not meddled in Babylonian affairs for
centuries, but she had gradually become alarmed at the
growth of Assyrian power. So Khumbanigash, the
Elamite king, allying himself with Merodach-baladan,
invaded Babylonia, laid siege to the frontier fortress of
Dêr or Dûr-ilu on the Lower Tigris, and defeated Sargon
and the Assyrian army before its walls. Merodach-baladan
was acknowledged by the Babylonians as their
king, and he continued to be a thorn in the side of
Assyria.</p>

</div>

<p>After the defeat of Shabaka and the Egyptians at
Raphia, Sargon was occupied with the final subjugation
of Urartu in the north, which had for so long
been a danger to Assyria. But Urartu had to fight,
not only the Assyrians, but also a new enemy, the
Cimmerians, who now made their appearance from the
north and east. In fact, Sargon's conquest of Urartu
resulted in the destruction of that people as a buffer
state, and laid Assyria open to the direct attack of the
barbarian invaders, though it was not until the reign
of Esarhaddon that their activity began to be formidable.
Meanwhile, having subjugated his other foes.
Sargon was able to turn his attention once more to
Babylon, from which he expelled Merodach-baladan.
His appearance was welcomed by the priestly party,
and, entering the city in state, he assumed the title
of Governor and for the last seven years of his life he
ruled in Babylon virtually as king. A memorial of his
occupation survives to-day in the quay-wall, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
constructed along the north front of the Southern
Citadel.<a name="FNanchor_39_570" id="FNanchor_39_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_570" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>On Sargon's death in 705 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the subject provinces
of the empire rebelled. The revolt was led by Babylon,
where Merodach-baladan reappears with Elamite support,<a name="FNanchor_40_571" id="FNanchor_40_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_571" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
while Hezekiah of Judah headed a confederation
of the states of Southern Syria. Sennacherib was first
occupied with Babylon, where he had little difficulty
in defeating Merodach-baladan and his allies. He was
then free to deal with Syria and Palestine; and at
Eltekeh, near Ekron, he routed the Egyptian army,
which had come to the support of the rebel states. He
then received the submission of Ekron, and took
Lachish after a siege, though Tyre resisted. After his
expulsion from Babylon Merodach-baladan had sought
safety by hiding himself in the Babylonian swamps,
where he allied himself with the Chaldean prince
Mushezib-Marduk; and Babylon had been left in
charge of Bêl-ibni, a young native Babylonian, who had
been brought up at the Assyrian court. A rising,
headed by Mushezib-Marduk, brought Sennacherib
again into the country, who, after defeating the rebels,
carried off Bêl-ibni and his nobles to Assyria, leaving
his own son Ashur-nadin-shum upon the throne.</p>

<p>The country was in a state of continual disaffection,
and after a few years a fresh revolt was headed by a
Babylonian, Nergal-ushezib. But he ruled for little
more than a year, being defeated by Sennacherib
and sent in chains to Nineveh. This took place after
the return of the Assyrian army from Nagitu, whither
it had been conveyed by Sennacherib, across the
head of the Persian Gulf, against the Chaldeans whom
Merodach-baladan had settled there.<a name="FNanchor_41_572" id="FNanchor_41_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_572" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Sennacherib then
turned his forces against Elam, and, after plundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
a considerable portion of the country, he was stopped in
his advance into the interior by the setting in of winter.
In his absence the Chaldean Mushezib-Marduk seized
the throne of Babylon, and allied himself with Elam.
But the combined armies were defeated at Khalule, and
after the death of Umman-menanu, the Elamite king,
in 689, Sennacherib seized Babylon. Exasperated at
her disaffection, he attempted to
put an end for all time to her
constant menace by destroying the
city. He succeeded in doing an
enormous amount of damage, and,
by deflecting the course of the
Euphrates, wiped out large areas
and turned them into swamps.<a name="FNanchor_42_573" id="FNanchor_42_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_573" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
For the last eight years of Sennacherib's
reign the country was
given over to a state of anarchy.</p>

THE GOD ADAD FROM A VOTIVE
OFFERING DEDICATED IN E-SAGILA
BY ESARHADDOS.</p>

<p class="caption">(After Weissbach.)</p>
</div>

<p>In 681 Sennacherib was murdered
by his sons, and, after a
struggle for the succession, Esarhaddon
secured the throne. His
first thought was to reverse completely
his father's Babylonian
policy, and by rebuilding the city
and restoring its ancient privileges
to placate the priestly party,
whose support his grandfather,
Sargon, had secured.<a name="FNanchor_43_574" id="FNanchor_43_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_574" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In 668 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
the statue of Marduk was restored
to its shrine, and Esarhaddon's
son, Shamash-shum-ukîn, was
proclaimed King of Babylon.
Esarhaddon sought to reconcile the military and aggressive
party in his own capital by crowning Ashur-bani-pal,
his eldest son, as king in Assyria. But
at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Babylon was still taught to look upon Assyria as her
suzerain, and the spirit of disaffection was only driven
for the moment underground. Esarhaddon's aim had
been to retain the territory already incorporated in the
Assyrian empire, and, had he been able to confine his
country's energies within these limits, its existence as a
state might have been prolonged. But he was unable
to curb the ambitions of his generals, and, in his effort
to find employment for the army, he achieved the
ultimate object of his father's western campaigns, the
conquest of Egypt.</p>

<p>It was soon apparent that Esarhaddon's occupation
of that country had been merely nominal, and it
thus fell to his son Ashur-bani-pal to continue the
Egyptian war, and to complete the work his father had
left unfinished. And though he met with far greater
success, he too in the end found the task of any
permanent conquest beyond his power.<a name="FNanchor_44_575" id="FNanchor_44_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_575" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> For he soon
had his hands full with troubles nearer home, in consequence
of which his hold on Egypt gradually relaxed.
Urtaku of Elam, who invaded Babylonia, does not
appear to have followed up his success; and the subsequent
invasion of the country by Teumman was only
followed by that ruler's defeat and death in battle.
But the strength of Elam was not broken by this
reverse, and, when Shamash-shum-ukîn revolted, he
received active Elamite support.</p>

<p>Not only in Elam, but also throughout the territory
controlled by Assyria, Shamash-shum-ukîn found support
in his rebellion, a fact significant of the detestation
of Assyrian rule in the scattered provinces of the
empire, which continued to be held together only by
fear. But the force at Ashur-bani-pal's disposal was
still powerful enough to stamp out the conflagration
and head off disaster for a time. He marched into
Babylonia, besieged and captured Babylon, and his
brother Shamash-shum-ukîn met his death in the flames
of his palace in 648 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The Assyrian king then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
invaded Elam, and, capturing its cities as he advanced,
he laid the country under fire and sword. Susa was
protected by its river, then in flood, but the Assyrian
army effected a crossing, and the ancient capital lay at
the mercy of the invaders. Having taken the city,
Ashur-bani-pal determined to break its power for ever,
after the manner Sennacherib had dealt with Babylon.
He not only stripped the temples and carried off the
treasures of the palace, but he even desecrated the royal
tombs, and completed his work of destruction by fire.
So Susa was plundered and destroyed, and in Babylon
itself Ashur-bani-pal continued to be supreme until his
death.<a name="FNanchor_45_576" id="FNanchor_45_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_576" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Babylonia had proved herself no match for the
legions of Assyria at the height of the hitter's power;
but the industrial and commercial life of her cities,
based ultimately on the rich return her soil yielded to
her agricultural population, enabled her to survive
blows which would have permanently disabled a country
less favoured by nature. Moreover, she always regarded
the Assyrians as an upstart people, who had borrowed
her culture, and whose land had been a mere province
of her kingdom at a time when her own political
influence had extended from Elam to the borders of
Syria. Even in her darkest hour she was buoyed up
by the hope of recovering her ancient glory, and she let
no opportunity slip of striking a blow at the northern
kingdom. She was consequently always a drag on
Assyria's advance to the Mediterranean, for, when the
latter's armies marched westward, they left Babylon and
Elam in their rear.</p>

<p>In her later dealings with Babylon Assyria had
tried the alternative policies of intimidation and in-dulgence,
but with equal want of success; and they
reached their climax in the reigns of Sennacherib and
Esarhaddon. It is quite possible that either of these
policies, if consistently pursued, would have been equally
futile in its aim of coercing or placating Babylonia.
But their alternation was a far worse blunder, as it only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
succeeded in revealing to the Babylonians their own
power, and in confirming them in their obstinate resistance.
To this cause we may trace the long revolt
under Shamash-shum-ukîn, when Babylon with Elam at
her back struck a succession of blows which helped in a
material degree to reduce the power of the Assyrian
army, already weakened by the Egyptian campaigns.
And in 625 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when the Scythians had overrun the
Assyrian empire, and her power was on the wane, we
find Nabopolassar proclaiming himself king in Babylon
and founding a new empire which for nearly seventy
years was to survive the city of Nineveh itself.</p>

their names are completely wanting in the Kings' List, some of them are

Sibir, a Babylonian king whom Ashur-nasir-pal mentions as having founded
Atlila, a city in Zamua, which he himself rebuilt as a royal residence and
renamed Dûr-Ashur (cf. "Annals," p. 325). It is improbable that Sibir was
one of the missing rulers of the Kassite Dynasty, the only other period to
which his reign could be assigned. For the broken name [....-akh]ê-iddina,
possibly that of another ruler of this period, see "Chronicles," II., p. 63.</p></div>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h5>


<h4>THE NEO-BABYLONIAN EMPIRE AND THE PERSIAN CONQUEST</h4>


<p>Freed from her Assyrian oppressors, Babylon
now renewed her youth, and the city attained a
material splendour and magnificence such as she
had not achieved during the long course of her earlier
history. But it took her more than a generation to
realize to the full her newly awakened ambitions. After
his declaration of independence, Nabopolassar's influence
did not extend far beyond the walls of Babylon and
Borsippa. The other great cities, both in the north and
south, continued for a time to acknowledge Assyrian
supremacy. But the sons of Ashur-bani-pal, who succeeded
him upon the throne, had inherited a reduced
empire, whose sole support, the Assyrian army, was
now largely composed of disheartened mercenaries. In
Ashur-bani-pal's reign there had been signs of coming
change and of the appearance of new races before whom
the Assyrians were doomed to disappear. The destruction
of Urartu had removed a vital barrier against the
incursion of the nomad tribes, and with its disappearance
we find new racial elements pressing into Western Asia,
of the same Indo-European family as that of the Medes
and their Iranian kinsfolk. These were the Scythians,
who in the middle of the seventh century had driven
the Cimmerians before them into Asia Minor, and it
was they who a generation later struck the death-blow
of the Assyrian empire, pouring across it in resistless
hordes. Assyria had no force in reserve with which to
oppose their progress or repair their ravages.</p>

<p>For centuries this great military power had struck
terror throughout Western Asia; but insatiable lust for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
dominion now met with its due reward. Since Sennacherib's
day the ranks of the army had been filled with
levies drawn from her subject peoples or with mercenary
troops, and these were a poor substitute for the race of
hardy fighters who had been sacrificed in their country's
countless wars. So when the Medes invested Nineveh,
with the possible assistance of the Scythians, and the
passive encouragement of Babylon, the capital could
look for no assistance from her provinces. According
to Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_1_577" id="FNanchor_1_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_577" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the Medes had already twice invaded
Assyria before the final investment; and it was natural
that Nabopolassar should have regarded them as his
allies, and have concluded a definite alliance with them
by marrying his son Nebuchadnezzar to the daughter
of Cyaxares, the Median king.<a name="FNanchor_2_578" id="FNanchor_2_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_578" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Sennacherib's mighty
walls kept the enemy at bay for three years, but in 606
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the city was taken by storm, and later ages preserved
the tradition that Sin-shar-ishkun, the Sarakos of
the Greeks, perished in the flames of his palace, rather
than fall alive into the besiegers' hands.</p>

<p>Though he does not appear to have taken any active
part in the long siege of Nineveh, Nabopolassar was not
slow in securing his share of the dismembered empire.
The northern territory of Assyria, including Northern
Mesopotamia,<a name="FNanchor_3_579" id="FNanchor_3_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_579" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> fell to the Medes, while the southern
districts became parts of Nabopolassar's empire under a
possible Median suzerainty.<a name="FNanchor_4_580" id="FNanchor_4_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_580" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But Babylon was soon to
put her newly organized army to the test. Two years
before the fall of Nineveh Egypt had seized the opportunity,
afforded her by Assyria's impotence, of occupying
Palestine and Syria.<a name="FNanchor_5_581" id="FNanchor_5_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_581" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> She had crushed Josiah and
his Hebrew army at Megiddo, and, though it is not
certain whether Judah had the support of other allies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
it is clear that Necho encountered no effective opposition
on his advance to the Euphrates. But Nabopolassar did
not intend to allow this portion of the Assyrian empire
to fall to Egypt unchallenged, and he despatched a
Babylonian force north-westwards along the Euphrates
under the command of the crown-prince, Nebuchadnezzar.
The two armies met at Carchemish in 604 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
where the Egyptians were utterly routed and driven
back through Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_6_582" id="FNanchor_6_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_582" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But Nebuchadnezzar did not
press his pursuit beyond the borders of Egypt, for news
reached him at Pelusium of Nabopolassar's death, and
he was obliged to return at once to Babylon in order to
carry out at the capital the necessary ceremonies attending
his accession to the throne.</p>

<p>In spite of his withdrawal from the country, the
greater part of Syria and Palestine lost no time in
transferring their allegiance to Babylon. The little
state of Judah was an exception, for, though she paid
her tribute at first, she soon put the warnings of the
prophet Jeremiah at defiance, and her short-sighted
revolt led to the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar
in 596 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and to the carrying away of a large
portion of her population into captivity. A few years
later Egypt made her last attempt to reoccupy Palestine
and Syria, and Judah joined the Phoenician cities of
Sidon and Tyre in rallying to her support. In 587
Nebuchadnezzar advanced into Northern Syria and took
up a strong strategic position at Riblah on the Orontes,
whence he despatched a part of his army to besiege
Jerusalem. An attempt by Apries, the Egyptian king,
to relieve the city was unsuccessful, and in 586 Jerusalem
was once more taken and the greater part of the remnant
of the Jews followed their fellow-countrymen into exile.<a name="FNanchor_7_583" id="FNanchor_7_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_583" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The Babylonian army then occupied Phoenicia, though
the city of Tyre offered an obstinate resistance and only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
acknowledged its allegiance to Babylon after a long siege,
which is said to have lasted for thirteen years.<a name="FNanchor_8_584" id="FNanchor_8_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_584" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Thus Nebuchadnezzar completed the work begun
by his father, Nabopolassar, and, by the skilful and
vigorous prosecution of his campaigns, established the
Neo-Babylonian empire on a firm basis, so that its
authority was unquestioned from the Persian Gulf to
the Egyptian frontier. Of his later campaigns nothing
has yet been published, beyond a fragmentary reference
to a conflict with Amasis of Egypt in the thirty-seventh
year of his reign.<a name="FNanchor_9_585" id="FNanchor_9_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_585" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Though we do not know the circumstances
under which it took place, we may assume that
the Babylonian army was again victorious against the
Egyptian troops and the Greek mercenaries who fought
in their ranks. A tradition is indeed preserved by
Josephus that Nebuchadnezzar made Egypt a Babylonian
province, and although this is certainly an exaggeration,
the evidence suggests that he may well have
conducted at least one successful campaign on Egyptian
territory. The troubles of Apries in consequence of his
ill-advised expedition against Cyrene, followed by the
revolt of Amasis and his own deposition and death, may
well have furnished the occasion for a successful invasion
of the country by Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>A very large number of inscriptions have been
recovered of the Neo-Babylonian kings, but, unlike the
foundation-records of Assyria, they contain no accounts
of military expeditions, but confine themselves to commemorating
the restoration or erection of temples and
palaces in Babylon and the other great cities in the land.
Considering his military successes, this is surprising in
Nebuchadnezzar's case, and the suggestion has been
made that he may have told us so little of his expeditions
and battles because they were perhaps undertaken
at the bidding of Media as his suzerain.<a name="FNanchor_10_586" id="FNanchor_10_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_586" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Cyaxares was
his kinsman, and the part played by Babylon in the
conflict of Media with Lydia may well be explained on
that hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>With the passing of Assyrian power the political
importance of Lydia had risen considerably, and under
Sadyattes and Alyattes, the successors of Ardys upon
the Lydian throne, the ravages of the Cimmerian invasion
were repaired. These monarchs had conducted a long
series of attacks upon the cities and states of Ionia,
and, though they were in the main successful, they
used up the resources of the nation without obtaining
material advantages in return. Handicapped to this
extent, Lydia entered upon a five years' struggle with
the growing power of Cyaxares, who pushed back her
eastern frontier. Matters came to a head in 585 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
when the great battle was fought on the Halys between
Cyaxares and Alyattes on May 28th. The battle is
famous for the total eclipse of the sun, which took place
on that day, and is said to have been foretold by the
Greek astronomer Thales of Miletus.<a name="FNanchor_11_587" id="FNanchor_11_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_587" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> By the subsequent
treaty the Halys was fixed as the frontier between
Lydia and the Median empire, and, according to Herodotus,
it was arranged in part through the mediation of
Nebuchadnezzar.<a name="FNanchor_12_588" id="FNanchor_12_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_588" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The intervention of Babylon must
have been undertaken in the Median interest, and it is
possible that Cyaxares could count on Nebuchadnezzar
for more than benevolent neutrality in case of need.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar appears in his inscriptions as a
mighty builder, and we have already seen how he transformed
the city of Babylon. He entirely rebuilt and
enlarged his father's royal palace,<a name="FNanchor_13_589" id="FNanchor_13_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_589" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and in the course of
his reconstructions raised its terraced platform to so
great a height above the surrounding city and plain,
that its Hanging Garden became one of the seven
wonders of the ancient world.<a name="FNanchor_14_590" id="FNanchor_14_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_590" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He rebuilt the great
temples of E-zida at Borsippa and of E-sagila at Babylon,
and the Sacred Procession-street within the city he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
sumptuously paved, spanning it between the temple of
Ninmakh and his own palace with the famous Ishtar
Gate, adorned with bulls and dragons in enamelled
relief.<a name="FNanchor_15_591" id="FNanchor_15_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_591" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The fortifications of the city he also greatly
strengthened by the extension of its double line of walls
and the erection of new citadels.<a name="FNanchor_16_592" id="FNanchor_16_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_592" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> During his long reign
of forty-two years he devoted his energies and the new
wealth of his kingdom to this work of rebuilding, both
in the capital and in the other ancient religious centres
of Babylonia.<a name="FNanchor_17_593" id="FNanchor_17_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_593" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The decoration of the façade of Nebuchadnezzar's
own palace reflects the influence of the West
upon Babylonian art; and we may picture her markets
and quays as thronged with foreign caravans and merchandise.
Evidence of her extended horizon at this
period may also be traced in the interest which Nebuchadnezzar
showed in the sea-traffic on the Persian Gulf,
which doubtless led him to construct a harbour in the
swamps, and to protect it against Arab raids by the
erection of the town of Teredon to the west of the
Euphrates, as an outpost on the desert frontier.<a name="FNanchor_18_594" id="FNanchor_18_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_594" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar's son, Amêl-Marduk, was an unworthy
successor to his father. During his short reign
he was restrained neither by law nor decency,<a name="FNanchor_19_595" id="FNanchor_19_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_595" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and it is
not surprising that in less than three years the priestly
party should have secured his assassination and have set
Neriglissar, his brother-in-law, in his place, a man of far
stronger character and a soldier.<a name="FNanchor_20_596" id="FNanchor_20_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_596" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The son of a private
Babylonian, Bêl-shum-ishkun, Neriglissar had married a
daughter of Nebuchadnezzar, and we may certainly
identify him with Nergal-sharezer, the Rab-mag or
Babylonian general who was present at the siege of
Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_21_597" id="FNanchor_21_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_597" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> A striking proof that Neriglissar enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
high military rank in Nebuchadnezzar's reign has
recently been obtained in a letter from Erech, which
was written by a captain in charge of a body of troops
stationed in the neighbourhood of that city.<a name="FNanchor_22_598" id="FNanchor_22_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_598" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The date
of the letter is certain, since the captain refers to soldiers
on the roll of Nebuchadnezzar and Neriglissar; and
incidentally it gives us a glimpse of the unsatisfactory
condition of the Babylonian army during Nebuchadnezzar's
closing years. The captain is anxious that the
depleted state of his company, and the measures he contemplates
in order to fill its ranks, should not be known
to Gubaru, who exercised a high command in Nebuchadnezzar's
army. It is possible that we may identify
this general with the governor of Gutium, who played
so prominent a part in the Persian conquest. Knowing,
as he doubtless did, the unsatisfactory condition of his
country's forces, he may perhaps have regarded the task
of opposing the invaders as quite beyond their powers.<a name="FNanchor_23_599" id="FNanchor_23_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_599" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Neriglissar's death, less than four years after his
accession, must certainly have been the death-blow to
any hopes his generals may have entertained of placing
the country's military organization and defence upon a
sound footing. For his son was little more than a child,
and after nine months' reign the priestly party at the
capital succeeded in deposing him in favour of one of
their own number, Nabonidus, a man of priestly descent<a name="FNanchor_24_600" id="FNanchor_24_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_600" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and thoroughly imbued with the traditions of the
hierarchy. The new king carried on Nebuchadnezzar's
tradition of temple-reconstruction with enthusiasm, but
he had none of his great predecessor's military aptitude.
To his own priestly detachment he added the unpractical
character of the archæologist, loving to occupy himself
in investigating the past history of the temples he
rebuilt, in place of controlling his country's administration.
The bent of his mind is well reflected in the

attached to the Moon-temple at Ur.<a name="FNanchor_25_601" id="FNanchor_25_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_601" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It is clear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
this act and the accompanying ceremonial interested
him far more than the education of his son; and any
military aptitude Belshazzar may have developed was
certainly not fostered by his father or his father's friends.
It was only when the enemy was at the frontier that
the king must have realized his own fatuity.</p>

<p>Thus with the accession of Nabonidus the close of
Babylon's last period of greatness is in sight. But the
empire did not crumble of its own accord, for in one of
his foundation-records the king boasts that the whole
of Mesopotamia and the West, as far as Gaza on
the Egyptian border, continued to acknowledge his
authority.<a name="FNanchor_26_602" id="FNanchor_26_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_602" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It required pressure from without to
shatter the decaying empire, which from the first
must have owed its success in no small measure to the
friendly and protective attitude of Media. When that
essential support was no longer forthcoming, it lay at
the mercy of the new power before which Media
herself had already gone down.</p>

<p>The Persian kingdom of Cyrus, rising on a new
wave of the Indo-European migration, had had little
difficulty in absorbing that of the Medes.<a name="FNanchor_27_603" id="FNanchor_27_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_603" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Five years
after the accession of Nabonidus, Cyrus had deposed
Astyages, and, uniting his own followers from the south
of Iran with their Median kinsfolk, he proceeded to
deal with Croesus of Lydia. Under her last king, the
successor of Alyattes, the power of Lydia had risen to
its greatest height, and the fame of Croesus' wealth had
attracted many of the more cultured Greeks to his court
at Sardis. But when Cyrus made himself master of the
Median empire, Croesus began to fear his growing
power. In 547 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> he fought an indecisive battle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the Persians at Pteria in Cappadocia, near the site of
the old Hittite capital, and he then retreated on Sardis.
Here he sent for assistance to Sparta, Egypt and
Babylon. But Cyrus did not delay before renewing his
attack, and he appeared unexpectedly before the capital.
The Lydian army was now signally defeated; Sardis,
in which Croesus had taken refuge, was captured after
a siege, and the Lydian empire brought to an end.
Cyrus was then free to turn his attention to Babylon.</p>

<p>If we should be right in identifying Gobryas or
Gubaru, the governor of Gutium, with the Babylonian
general of that name, who had held high position under
Nebuchadnezzar,<a name="FNanchor_28_604" id="FNanchor_28_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_604" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> we may trace the speed and ease of the
Persian conquest of Babylonia directly to his action in
espousing the cause of the invader. Foreseeing that the
only hope for his country lay in its speedy submission, he
may have considered that he would be acting in its best
interests if he did not oppose its incorporation within
the Persian empire, but rendered the revolution so far
as possible a peaceful one. That would explain the
action of Cyrus in entrusting the invasion largely to his
hands; and the subsequent revolt of Sippar is the more
easily accounted for if a Babylonian general with Gubaru's
reputation had appeared as the envoy of the Persian
king. In any case we must assume that a large section
of the Akkadian population was of that way of thinking,
quite apart from the opposition to himself that Nabonidus
had aroused in the priestly party of the capital.</p>

<p>The defence of the country was entrusted by Nabonidus
to his son Belshazzar, who met the advancing
Persians at Opis, where he was defeated; and, as often
as he attempted to rally his forces, they were again
dispersed.<a name="FNanchor_29_605" id="FNanchor_29_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_605" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Sippar then opened its gates without
fighting, Nabonidus fled, and Gubaru advancing on the
capital secured its peaceful surrender. The native
chronicler of these events records that, during the early
days of the Persian occupation of the city, the shields
of Gutium surrounded the doors of E-sagila, so that
no man's spear entered the sacred shrines and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
military standard was brought in.<a name="FNanchor_30_606" id="FNanchor_30_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_606" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The record gains
fresh meaning if we may assume that the governor
of Gutium was himself of native origin and a former
general of the Babylonian army. On the third day of
the following month Cyrus made his state entry into
the capital, being received by all classes, and especially
by the priesthood and the nobles, as a liberator. He
appointed Gubaru his governor of Babylon, and the
latter appears to have stamped out further resistance
by pursuing Belshazzar and putting him to death.<a name="FNanchor_31_607" id="FNanchor_31_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_607" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Nabonidus had already been taken, when the capital
surrendered.</p>

<p>It is perhaps remarkable that the native priesthood,
from whose ranks Nabonidus himself had sprung, should
have welcomed the Persian king as their country's
deliverer, whose victory had been brought about by
Marduk, the national god. But, after securing the
secular control, Nabonidus had given free rein to his
priestly ambition, and, as a consequence, had estranged
his own party. His imagination may have been fired by
some ill-advised scheme of centralizing worship; but,
whatever his motive, the king had collected many of
the cult-images throughout the country into the capital,
little recking that he thereby tore the gods from their
ancient habitations. By restoring the gods to their
local shrines, Cyrus gained in popularity, and completely
won over the priesthood, by far the most powerful
political section of the community.<a name="FNanchor_32_608" id="FNanchor_32_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_608" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Thus it happened
that Babylon made no further struggle to retain her
freedom, and the whole of the territory she had enjoyed
was incorporated without resistance in the Persian
empire.</p>

<p>With the permanent loss of Babylon's independence,
the period covered by this history draws to an end.
The epoch forms a convenient stopping-place; but,
unlike the fall of the Assyrian empire, her conquest
made but little difference to the life and activities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the population as a whole. It may therefore be permissible
to glance ahead a little, and note her subsequent
fortunes as a subject province, under the foreign domination
of the powers which succeeded one another in
the rule of that region of Western Asia. The tranquillity
of the country under Cyrus formed a striking
contrast to the unrest and intrigue which characterized
its attitude under Assyrian rule; and this was due to
the fact that the policy he inaugurated in the provinces
of his empire was a complete reversal of Assyrian
methods. For the nationality of each conquered race
was respected, and it was encouraged to retain its own
religion and its laws and customs. Hence Babylon's
commercial life and prosperity suffered no interruption
in consequence of the change in her political status.
Taxation was not materially increased, and little was
altered beyond the name and title of the reigning king
in the dates upon commercial and legal documents.<a name="FNanchor_33_609" id="FNanchor_33_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_609" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>This state of things would doubtless have continued,
had not the authority of the Persian empire itself been
rudely shaken during the reign of Cambyses, Cyrus'
son and successor. The conquest of Egypt and its
incorporation as an integral part of the Achæmenian
empire, to which he directed his main energies, were
achieved after the battle of Pelusium and the fall
of Memphis. But when attempting to extend his
sway over Nubia in the south, he received news of
revolt in Persia. Before his departure for Egypt
he had murdered his brother Bardiya, known to the
Greeks as Smerdis. The murder had been kept a
secret, and the revolt against the absent king was now
headed by a Magian, named Gaumata, who gave himself
out as the missing Smerdis and the true heir to
the throne.<a name="FNanchor_34_610" id="FNanchor_34_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_610" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Cambyses made preparations to repress
the revolt, but died on his return journey in Syria in
522. The death of the king gave a fresh impetus to
the forces of rebellion, which now began to spread
through the provinces of the Persian empire. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Gaumata, the Persian rebel, soon met his fate. For
after Cambyses' death, the Persian army was led back
by Darius, a prince of the same house as Cyrus and
his son; Gaumata was surprised and murdered, and
Darius firmly established on the throne. Darius continued
to act with extraordinary energy, and in the
course of a single year succeeded in quelling the
rebellions in Babylon and in the various provinces.<a name="FNanchor_35_611" id="FNanchor_35_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_611" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
On the rock-face of Behistun in Persia, on the road
from Babylon to Ecbatana, he has left us sculptured
portraits of himself and the rebel leaders he subdued.
The latter include Nidintu-Bêl and Arakha, the two
pretenders to the Babylonian throne.<a name="FNanchor_36_612" id="FNanchor_36_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_612" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The sieges of Babylon by Darius mark the beginning
of the city's decay. Her defences had not been seriously
impaired by Cyrus, but they now suffered considerably.
The city was again restless during Darius' closing years,<a name="FNanchor_37_613" id="FNanchor_37_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_613" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and further damage was done to it in the reign of
Xerxes, when the Babylonians made their last bids for
independence.<a name="FNanchor_38_614" id="FNanchor_38_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_614" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> For Xerxes is said not only to have
dismantled the walls, but to have plundered and
destroyed the great temple of Marduk itself. Large
areas in the city, which had been a wonder of the
nations, now began to lie permanently in ruins. Babylon
entered on a new phase in 331 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when the long
struggle between Greece and Persia was ended by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
defeat of Darius III. at Gaugamela. For Susa and
Babylon submitted to Alexander, who on proclaiming
himself King of Asia, took Babylon as his capital. We
may picture him gazing on the city's great buildings,
many of which now lay ruined and deserted. Like
Cyrus before him, he sacrificed to Babylon's gods; and
he is said to have wished to restore E-sagila, Marduk's
great temple, but to have given up the idea, as it would
have taken ten thousand men more than two months
to remove the rubbish from the ruins. But he seems
to have made some attempt in that direction, since a
tablet has been found, dated in his sixth year, which
records a payment of ten manehs of silver for "clearing
away the dust of E-sagila."<a name="FNanchor_39_615" id="FNanchor_39_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_615" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

</div>

<p>While the old buildings decayed, some new ones
arose in their place, including a Greek theatre for the
use of the large Greek colony.<a name="FNanchor_40_616" id="FNanchor_40_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_616" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Many of the Babylonians
themselves adopted Greek names and fashions, but the
more conservative elements, particularly among the
priesthood, continued to retain their own separate life and
customs. In the year 270 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> we have a record that
Antiochus Soter restored the temples of Nairn and
Marduk at Babylon and Borsippa,<a name="FNanchor_41_617" id="FNanchor_41_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_617" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and the recent diggings
at Erech have shown that the old temple in that city
retained its ancient cult under a new name.<a name="FNanchor_42_618" id="FNanchor_42_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_618" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In the
second century we know that, in a corner of the great
temple at Babylon, Marduk and the God of Heaven
were worshipped as a two-fold deity under the name
of Anna-Bêl; and we hear of priests attached to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
of Babylon's old shrines as late as the year 29 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
Services in honour of the later forms of the Babylonian
gods were probably continued into the Christian era.</p>

<p>The life of the ancient city naturally flickered longest
around the ruined temples and seats of worship. On
the secular side, as a commercial centre, she was then
but a ghost of her former self. Her real decay had set
in when Seleucus, after securing the satrapy of Babylon
on Alexander's death, had recognized the greater advantages
offered by the Tigris for maritime communication.
On the foundation of Seleucia, Babylon as a city
began rapidly to decay. Deserted at first by the official
classes, followed later by the merchants, she decreased
in importance as her rival grew. Thus it was by a
gradual and purely economic process, and through no
sudden blow, that Babylon slowly bled to death.</p>

<h4>GREECE, PALESTINE AND BABYLON: AN ESTIMATE OF
CULTURAL INFLUENCE</h4>

<p>During the Persian and Hellenistic periods
Babylon exerted an influence upon contemporary
races of which we may trace some survivals
in the civilization of the modern world. She was
the mother of astronomy, and the twelve divisions on
the dial of our clocks and watches were ultimately derived,
through Greek channels, from her ancient system
of time-division. It was under the Neo-Babylonian
kings that the Hebrew race first came into close contact
with her culture, and there can be no doubt that the
Jews, in the time of their captivity, renewed their interest
in her mythology when they found it presented some
parallels to their own. But in the course of this history
it has been shown that, during far earlier periods, the
civilization of Babylon had penetrated throughout a
great part of Western Asia. It is admitted that, as a
result of her westward expansion at the time of the First
Dynasty, her culture had spread during subsequent
periods to the Mediterranean coast-lands, and had
moulded to some extent the development of those
peoples with whom it came in contact. And since the
religious element dominated her own activities in a
greater measure than was the case with most other
races of antiquity, it has been urged that many features
in Hebrew religion and in Greek mythology can only
be rightly explained by Babylonian beliefs in which they
had their origin. It is the purpose of this chapter to
examine a theory of Babylon's external influence, which
has been propagated by a school of writers and has
determined the direction of much recent research.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to insist on the manner in
which material drawn from Babylonian and Assyrian
sources has helped to elucidate points in the political
and religious history of Israel. Scarcely less striking,
though not so numerous, are the echoes from Babylonian
legends which have long been recognized as existing in
Greek mythology. The best known example of direct
borrowing is undoubtedly the myth of Adonis and
Aphrodite, the main features of which correspond closely
to the Babylonian legend of Tammuz and Ishtar. In
this case not only the myth, but the accompanying
festival and rites were also borrowed, passing to Greece
by way of Byblos on the Syrian coast and Paphos in
Cyprus, both centres of Astarte worship.<a name="FNanchor_1_619" id="FNanchor_1_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_619" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Another
Greek legend, obviously of Babylonian origin, is that of
Actseon, who is clearly to be identified with the
shepherd, loved by Ishtar and changed by her into a
leopard, so that he was hunted and killed by his own
hounds.<a name="FNanchor_2_620" id="FNanchor_2_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_620" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Some parallels have also long been pointed out
between the national heroes Heracles and Gilgamesh.
It is true that most races of antiquity possess stories of
national heroes of superhuman strength and power, but
there are certain features in the traditions concerning
Heracles which may have some ultimate connexion
with the Gilgamesh cycle of legends.<a name="FNanchor_3_621" id="FNanchor_3_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_621" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Less convincing
is the analogy which has been suggested between Icarus
and Etana, the Babylonian hero or demi-god, who succeeded
in flying to the highest heaven only to fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
headlong to the earth. For in Etana's case there is no
question of human flight: he was carried to heaven by
his friend the Eagle, to whose wings he clung while they
mounted to heaven's gates. But the examples already
referred to may suffice to illustrate the way in which it
has long been agreed that Babylonian mythology may
have left its impress on that of Greece.</p>

<p>But the views now held by a considerable body of
scholars suggest a much broader extension of Babylonian
influence than is implied by a series of isolated
and fortuitous connexions; and, as the character of this
influence is <i>ex hypothesi</i> astronomical, any attempt to
define its limits with precision is a matter of some
difficulty. For it will be obvious that, if we may
assume an astronomical basis or background to any two
mythologies, we at once detect a great number of
common features the existence of which we should not
otherwise have suspected. And the reason is not far to
seek; for the astronomical phenomena with which we
go to work are necessarily restricted in number, and
they have to do duty many times over as a background
in each system.<a name="FNanchor_4_622" id="FNanchor_4_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_622" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In spite of this disadvantage, which is
inherent in their theory, Winckler and his school have
rendered good service in working out the general relationship
which was believed by the Babylonians to exist
between the heavenly bodies and the earth.<a name="FNanchor_5_623" id="FNanchor_5_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_623" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He has
shown sound reasons for assuming that, according to
the tenets of Babylonian astrology, events and institutions
on earth were in a certain sense copies of heavenly
prototypes.</p>

<p>It is well known that the Babylonians, like the
Hebrews, conceived the universe as consisting of three
parts: the heaven above, the earth beneath, and the
waters under the earth. The Babylonians gradually
elaborated this conception of the universe, and traced
in the heavens a parallel to the threefold division of
earth, separating the universe into a heavenly and an
earthly world. The earthly universe consisted as before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
of three divisions, that is to say the heaven (limited to
the air or atmosphere above the earth), the earth itself,
and the waters beneath it. Those corresponded in the
heavenly world to the Northern heaven, the Zodiac,
and the Southern heaven or heavenly ocean. By the
later Babylonian period the greater gods had long become
identified with the planets, and the lesser gods
with the fixed stars, each deity having his special house
or star in heaven in addition to his temple on earth.
This idea appears to have been carried still further by
the later Greek astrologers, by whom lands and cities
in addition to temples were thought to have their
cosmic counterparts.<a name="FNanchor_6_624" id="FNanchor_6_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_624" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But even for the Babylonians
the moving stars were not merely symbols serving as
interpreters to men of the divine will; their movements
were the actual cause of events on earth. To use an
apposite simile of Winckler, heaven was believed to be
related to earth much as a moving object seen in a
mirror was related to its reflection.<a name="FNanchor_7_625" id="FNanchor_7_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_625" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p class="caption">LIMESTONE STATUE OF THE GOD NABÛ AT NIMRÛD.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to illustrate the way in which these astral
ideas are said to have supplied material to Greek mythology,
a test instance may be selected, the suggested
explanation of which involves one of the essential
features of Winckler's astral system as he eventually
elaborated it.<a name="FNanchor_8_626" id="FNanchor_8_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_626" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> We will take the story of the Golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Lamb of Atreus and Thyestes, which is introduced by
Euripides into one of the choruses in his <i>Electra</i><a name="FNanchor_9_627" id="FNanchor_9_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_627" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
According to the story, which is referred to, but not
explicitly told, by Euripides, the Lamb with the Golden
Fleece was brought by Pan to Atreus, and was regarded
by the Argives as a sign that he was the true king.
But his brother Thyestes, with the help of Atreus' wife,
stole it and claimed to be king; so strife ensued, good
was turned to evil, and the stars were shaken in their
courses. It is curious that the theft of the Lamb
should have such a special effect upon the heavens and
the weather, for this is definitely stated in the second
strophe and antistrophe of the chorus.<a name="FNanchor_10_628" id="FNanchor_10_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_628" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Though details
are obscure, it is clear that we here have a legend with
strongly marked astrological elements. The theft of
the Lamb changes the sun's course, and from other lines
in the chorus we gather that the alteration led to the
present climatic conditions of the world, the rain-clouds
flying northward and leaving "the seats of
Amnion"&mdash;that is, the Libyan desert&mdash;parched and
dewless.</p>

<p>In its original form the legend may well have been
a story of the First Sin, after which the world was
changed to its present state, both moral and atmospheric.<a name="FNanchor_11_629" id="FNanchor_11_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_629" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
There is definite evidence that the Golden
Lamb was identified with the constellation Aries; and
since Babylon was admittedly the home of astrology, it
is not an improbable suggestion, in spite of the reference
to Ammon, that we should regard it as one of the
lost legends of Babylon. According to Winckler's
theory of the Babylonian religion, we should go further,
and trace the origin of the legend to a convulsion in
Babylonian thought which took place in the ninth and
eighth centuries <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> At this period, it is asserted, the
sun at the vernal equinox was moving from the constellation
Taurus into Aries, The bull, according to
the theory, was identified with Marduk, the god of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_12_630" id="FNanchor_12_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_630" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and all the time he was yielding his place to
the Ram, Babylon was declining before the power of
Assyria. The disorganization of the calendar and the
seasons, due to the imperfect method of time-reckoning
in vogue, was associated with this event, giving an
impetus to a fresh birth of legends, one of which has
found its way in a Greek dress into this chorus of
Euripides. Or, as it has been put rather differently, the
story is a piece of Babylonian astronomy misunderstood.</p>

<p>The theory underlying this interpretation of the
legend is based on the axiom that the Babylonian
religion was essentially a star-worship, and that behind
every department of the national literature, secular as
well as religious, lay the same astral conception of the
universe. Before treating the theory in greater detail,
it may be well to ascertain how far the history of the
country substantiates this view. In the earliest period
of which we have recovered material remains there can
be no doubt that image-worship formed a characteristic
feature of the Babylonian religious system, though we
have no means of tracing its gradual evolution out of
the fetish and stock-and-stone worship which necessarily
preceded it.<a name="FNanchor_13_631" id="FNanchor_13_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_631" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The extraneous civilization, which
the Sumerians introduced, most probably included cult-images
of their gods, and these may well have been
already anthropomorphic. Fashioned in the god's
form, the image was believed to enshrine his presence,
and for the Babylonians of all periods it never lost this
animistic character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
A tribal or city-god, in his earliest stage of development,
was doubtless wholly identified with his cult-image.
No more than one image of each was worshipped,
and the idea of a god's existence apart from this
visible form must have been of gradual growth.<a name="FNanchor_14_632" id="FNanchor_14_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_632" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The
misfortunes of the material image, especially if unaccompanied
by national disaster, would have fostered a belief
in the god's existence apart from his visible body of wood
or stone. And such a belief eventually developed into
the Babylonian conception of a heavenly division of the
universe, in which the great gods had their dwelling,
making their presence manifest to men in the stars and
planets that moved across the sky. But this development
marked a great advance upon pure image-worship,
and undoubtedly followed the growth of a pantheon out
of a collection of separate and detached city-gods. We
have no means of dating the association of some of the
greater gods with natural forces. It would seem that,
in the earlier Sumerian period, religious centres in the
country were already associated with lunar and solar
cults and with other divisions of nature-worship. But
it is quite certain that, during all subsequent stages of
Babylonian history, the divine image never degenerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
into a mere symbol of divinity. Without consciously
postulating a theory in explanation of his belief, the
Babylonian found no difficulty in reconciling a localization
of the divine person with his presence at other
cult centres and ultimately with a separate life in the
heavenly sphere.</p>

<p>That this was actually the case is proved by a number
of historical examples. With the rise of Babylon we
may note the important part which the actual image of
Marduk played in each coronation
ceremony and in the renewal of the
king's oath at every subsequent Feast
of the New Year; the hands of no
other image than that in E-sagila
would serve for the king to grasp.
In Hammurabi's reign we see the
Babylonian's conception of his visible
gods reflected in his treatment of
foreign images.<a name="FNanchor_15_633" id="FNanchor_15_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_633" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The international
exchange of deities in the fourteenth
and thirteenth centuries has already
been referred to,<a name="FNanchor_16_634" id="FNanchor_16_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_634" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the recovery
of captured images was always recorded
with enthusiasm.<a name="FNanchor_17_635" id="FNanchor_17_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_635" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> For the
images themselves constituted a
nation's chief weapon of offence, and
there was always the chance that, if
properly treated by their captors, they
might transfer their influence to the
other side. This close connexion between the god and
his image survived into the Neo-Babylonian period,
and Nabonidus' offence in the eyes of the priesthood
was simply that he ignored the feeling. Historical
evidence thus suggests that the astral aspect of divinity
in Babylonia was not an original feature of its religious
system, and that it was never adopted to the exclusion
of more primitive ideas.</p>

<p>A similar result follows if we examine the relation
of a Babylonian deity to his sculptured emblem, by
means of which his authority or presence could in
certain circumstances be secured or indicated. The
origin of such emblems was not astrological, nor is it
to be sought in liver-augury: they were not derived
from fancied resemblances to animals or objects, presented
either by constellations in heaven, or by markings
on the liver of a victim. It is clear that they arose
in the first instance from the characters or attributes
assumed by the gods in the mythology; their transference
to constellations was a secondary process, and their
detection in liver-markings resulted, not in their own
origin but in that of the omen.<a name="FNanchor_18_636" id="FNanchor_18_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_636" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In the earliest period
the emblem of a city-god might symbolize his city's
power,<a name="FNanchor_19_637" id="FNanchor_19_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_637" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and those of other deities expressed some
quality in the character of their possessor, or were
drawn from a weapon, object or animal with which
they were associated in tradition.<a name="FNanchor_20_638" id="FNanchor_20_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_638" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Another class of images were the animal forms, also
drawn largely from the mythology, which adorned the
earlier temples and were reproduced in enamelled brickwork
on secular buildings by the Neo-Babylonian kings.
Most of these, in the later as in the earlier periods, were
placed near temple-entrances, and where stone was so
plentiful that it could be used in bulk in the structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
of buildings, the doorways themselves were carved in
the same way. That animal forms were employed to
symbolize sound is suggested by the representation of a
great harp or lyre on a Sumerian-bas-relief, in which
the figure of a bull surmounting the sound-case is
evidently intended to suggest the peculiarly deep and
vibrant tones of the instrument.<a name="FNanchor_21_639" id="FNanchor_21_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_639" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Moreover, on cylinder-seals
engraved with the figure of the Sun-god emerging
from the Eastern Gate of heaven, two lions are often
set immediately above the opening doors, and in one
specimen the gate-pivots rest upon a second pair
arranged symmetrically below them.<a name="FNanchor_22_640" id="FNanchor_22_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_640" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The symbolism of these and similar monsters may
well have been suggested by the grinding of the heavy
doors in their stone sockets and the shrieking of thair
bolts.<a name="FNanchor_23_641" id="FNanchor_23_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_641" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The noises suggested the cries of animals, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
in accordance with the tenets of primitive animism, were
thought to inhabit the doors and gateways and to guard
them. We may probably trace to this ancestry the
colossal lions and winged bulls which flanked the doorways
of Assyrian and Persian palaces, and, like the
enamelled monsters of Babylon and Persepolis, continued
to be reproduced as divine guardians of a building
after their primitive associations had been forgotten

<p>Archæological evidence thus supports the view,
already deduced from historical considerations, that
astrology did not dominate the religious activities of
Babylon. And an examination of the literature points to
the same conclusion. Magic and divination bulk largely
in the texts recovered, and in their case there is nothing
to suggest an underlying astrological element.<a name="FNanchor_25_643" id="FNanchor_25_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_643" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> We
are the less inclined, therefore, to accept the axiom that
an astral conception of the universe permeated and
coloured Babylonian thought to such an extent, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
not only myths and legends, but even historical events,
were recorded in terms which reflect the movements of
the sun, moon and planets and the other phenomena
of the heavens. If we once grant this assumption, it
might perhaps have followed, as the astral mythologists
claim, that the beliefs of the Babylonian star-worshippers
became the prevailing doctrine of the ancient East and
left their traces broadcast upon the records of antiquity.
But the original assumption appears to be unsound, and
the theory can only find support by treating late evidence
as applicable to all stages of Babylonian history.</p>

</div>

<p>The roots of the theory are placed in a purely
imaginary age, where evidence for or against it is lacking.
Thus the oldest monuments which have been recovered
upon Babylonian sites are not considered relics of the
early stages of Babylonian culture.<a name="FNanchor_26_644" id="FNanchor_26_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_644" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It is asserted that
in the periods behind them there existed an elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
and highly developed civilization, lying back in the
darkness beyond the earliest extant records. In the
total absence of material evidence, it is no difficult task
to paint this age in colours which are shared by no other
early or primitive race in the world's history. It is
assumed that war and violence had no existence in
Babylonia in this prehistoric time. Intellect dominated
and controlled the passions of the primeval but highly
gifted people, and in particular one form of intellectual
conception based on a scientific knowledge of astronomy.
It is postulated that a purely astronomical theory of the
universe lay at the root of their civilization, and
governed their whole thought and conduct. This was
no teaching of a learned priesthood, but was a universally
held belief which permeated every branch of the
national and individual life. The theory in its perfect
and uncorrupted state had perished with the other
relics of its inventors. But it was inherited by the
Semitic immigrants into Babylonia, and, though employed
by them in an altered and corrupted form,
has, it is said, left its traces in the later records.
In this way the astral mythologist would explain
the fragmentary character of his data, from which
he claims to reconstruct the original beliefs in their
entirety.</p>

<p>One such belief has been preserved by Seneca,<a name="FNanchor_27_645" id="FNanchor_27_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_645" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> who,
giving Berossus as his authority, refers to a Chaldean
theory of a great year, a long cosmical period having,
like the year, a summer and a winter. The summer is
marked by a great conflagration produced by the conjunction
of all the planets in Cancer, and the winter is
characterized by a universal deluge caused by a similar
conjunction of all the planets in Capricorn. The idea
is evidently based on the conception that, as the succession
of day and night corresponds to the changes of
the seasons, so the year itself must correspond to greater
cycles of time. Though Berossus is our earliest authority,
the doctrine is regarded as a primitive Babylonian one.
It is further argued that, even in the earliest period, the
inhabitants of Babylonia conceived the history of the
world to have been evolved in a series of successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
ages, bearing the same relation to these aeons of the
world-cycle as the year bore to them.</p>

<p>The theory of Ages of the World is familiar enough
from the classical conception, first met with in Hesiod's
"Works and Days,"<a name="FNanchor_28_646" id="FNanchor_28_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_646" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> which profoundly influenced later
Greek speculation. There is nothing particularly astral
about Hesiod's conception of four ages, distinguished
by the principal metals and showing progressive
deterioration. But it is claimed that Hesiod's theory,
and all parallel conceptions of World-Ages, are derived
from a Babylonian prototype, Hesiod's Golden Age
reflecting the general condition of prehistoric Babylonia.
Assuming a close correspondence between the zodiac
and the earth in early Babylonian thought, it is argued
that the inhabitants of the country from the earliest
periods divided the world's history into ages of about
two thousand years each, according to the particular
sign of the zodiac in which the sun stood each year at
the vernal equinox, when the New Year's Festival was
celebrated.<a name="FNanchor_29_647" id="FNanchor_29_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_647" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Although these ages are never named nor
mentioned in the inscriptions, they are referred to by
the astral mythologists as the Ages of the Twins, the
Bull, and the Ram,<a name="FNanchor_30_648" id="FNanchor_30_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_648" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> from the zodiacal constellations of
Gemini, Taurus, and Aries.</p>

<p>This is a vital point of the theory and it postulates
on the part of the early Babylonians a highly accurate
knowledge of astronomy: it assumes a knowledge of the
procession of the equinoxes, which could only be based
on a very rigid system of astronomical observation and
record.<a name="FNanchor_31_649" id="FNanchor_31_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_649" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But the ancient Babylonians are supposed to
have been quite familiar with these facts, and to have
traced a close connexion between them and the world's
history. Certain myths are supposed to have characterized
each of these world ages, not only affecting
religious beliefs, but so obsessing Babylonian thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
that they influenced historical writings. As the sun at
the vernal equinox gradually progressed through the
ecliptic constellations, so, according to the theory, the
history of the world was believed to be evolved in
harmony with its course, and the pre-ordained fate of
the universe was slowly unrolled.</p>

<p>Up to this point the astral theory is very complete
and, granting its original hypotheses, it goes smoothly
enough. But as soon as its authors try to fit the existing
legends to their theory, difficulties begin. In
Babylonian mythology we find no pair of heroes who
present any resemblance to the Dioscuri. But lunar
cults were prominent in the earliest Babylonian epoch,
and, in default of any closer parallel, the two phases of
the waxing and the waning moon have been treated as
characterizing the myths and legends of the Age of
the Twins. Borrowing a term from music, they are
described as the characteristic <i>motif</i> of the age. The
second Age, that of the Bull, begins roughly with the
rise of Babylon to power. There is very slender evidence
for connecting Marduk, the god of Babylon, with the
zodiacal constellation of the Bull, but the connexion is
confidently assumed.<a name="FNanchor_32_650" id="FNanchor_32_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_650" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The Third Age, that of the
Ram, presents even more difficulties than its two predecessors,
for no amount of ingenuity can discover material
for a Ram <i>motif</i> at Babylon. But Jupiter Amnion was
represented with the head of a ram, and he is assumed
to have been identical in his nature with Marduk.
Thus the new reckoning is supposed to have passed over
to Egypt, while Babylon remained unaffected.<a name="FNanchor_33_651" id="FNanchor_33_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_651" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The
explanation put forward is that the Ram Age began at
a time when the power of Babylon was on the decline;
but why the Babylonians should therefore have ignored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the true position of the sun at the vernal equinox is not
quite obvious.</p>

<p>The foreign influence of Babylon's conception of the
universe is said to have left its strongest imprint on
Hebrew historical writing. It is claimed that the
Biblical narratives relating to the earlier history of the
Hebrews have in particular been influenced by the
Babylonian myths of the universe, and that a great
number of passages have in consequence an astral significance.
This side of the subject has been worked out
in detail by Dr. Alfred Jeremias,<a name="FNanchor_34_652" id="FNanchor_34_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_652" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and a few examples
will suffice to illustrate the system of interpretation
which is suggested. We will take one of the Babylonian
legends which is said to be most frequently encountered
in the Hebrew narratives, the Descent of the goddess
Ishtar into the Underworld in search of her youthful
husband Tammuz, which in its Babylonian form is unquestionably
a nature-myth. There can be little doubt
that in the myth Tammuz represents the vegetation of
spring; this, after being parched up by the summer-heat,
is absent from the earth during the winter months,
until restored by the goddess of fertility. There is also
no doubt that the cult of Tammuz eventually spread
into Palestine, for Ezekiel in a vision saw women at the
north gate of the temple at Jerusalem weeping for
Tammuz.<a name="FNanchor_35_653" id="FNanchor_35_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_653" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> We have already noted its arrival in Greece
in the story of Adonis and Aphrodite.<a name="FNanchor_36_654" id="FNanchor_36_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_654" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In its Greek
form the contest between Aphrodite and Persephone
for the possession of Adonis reproduces the struggle
between Ishtar and Ereshkigal in the Abode of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Dead; and the annual disappearance and reappearance
of Tammuz gives rise in the Greek version to the decision
of Zeus that Adonis should spend one part of the year
above ground with Aphrodite and the other part underground
with Persephone.<a name="FNanchor_37_655" id="FNanchor_37_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_655" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Such are the main facts,
which are not disputed, concerning this particular Babylonian
myth. We may now note the manner in which
it is said that <i>motifs</i> from it are interwoven in the Old
Testament with traditions concerning the early history
of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>It is well known that in early Christian writings,
such as the Syriac "Hymn of the Soul," a Gnostic
composition of the second or third century A.D.,<a name="FNanchor_38_656" id="FNanchor_38_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_656" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> the
land of Egypt is sometimes referred to in a metaphorical
or allegorical sense. It is suggested that the story of
Abraham's journey with his wife Sarah into Egypt<a name="FNanchor_39_657" id="FNanchor_39_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_657" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> may
have been written, by a parallel system of allegory, in
terms reflecting a descent into the underworld and a
rescue from it. It is true that in the story Pharaoh's
house is plagued, probably with sterility, a feature that
recalls the cessation of fertility on earth while the goddess
of love remains in the underworld. But the same
<i>motif is</i> traced in the rescue of Lot from Sodom: here
Sodom is the underworld. The pit into which Joseph
is thrown by his brethren and the prison into which
Potiphar casts him also represent the underworld: and
his two fellow-prisoners, the chief baker and the chief
butler, are two minor deities in Marduk's household.<a name="FNanchor_40_658" id="FNanchor_40_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_658" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
The cave at Makkedah, in which the five kings of the
Amorites hid themselves after their defeat by Joshua,<a name="FNanchor_41_659" id="FNanchor_41_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_659" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
is said to have the same <i>motif</i> underlying it. In short,
any cave, or prison, or state of misery mentioned in the
Hebrew narratives may, according to astral interpretation,
be taken as representing the underworld.<a name="FNanchor_42_660" id="FNanchor_42_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_660" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>The one other <i>motif</i> we will take from the Babylonian
mythology is the Dragon-combat, since this
illustrates the principal pattern, or system, on which the
astral mythologist arranges his material. In the Babylonian
story of the Creation it will be recalled how
Tiamat, the dragon of chaos, revolted with Apsû,
the god of the abyss, against the new and ordered
ways of the gods; how Marduk, the champion of the
gods, defeated her, and, cutting her body in half, used
one half of her as a firmament for the heaven, and then
proceeded to carry out his other works of creation.<a name="FNanchor_43_661" id="FNanchor_43_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_661" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
The probability has long been noted that the Dragon-combat
may have suggested certain metaphorical phrases
or descriptions in Hebrew poetical and prophetic
literature.<a name="FNanchor_44_662" id="FNanchor_44_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_662" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But the astral mythologist uses it as the
dominant <i>motif</i> of his Age of Taurus; and, since this
age began, according to his theory, before the period of
Abraham, the Marduk myths are traced more frequently
than any others in the Old Testament. The astral god
plays the part of a deliverer in the mythology: hence any
Biblical hero who is recorded to have rescued any one,
or to have delivered his family or people, forms a convenient
peg on which to hang a <i>motif</i> So too the birth
of the founder of a dynasty, or of the inaugurator of a
new age, is said to reflect the solar <i>motif</i> of the birth of
the spring sun.<a name="FNanchor_45_663" id="FNanchor_45_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_663" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In this process of detecting hidden <i>motifs,</i> numbers
play an important part. To take one example, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
said to indicate that David's fight with Goliath reflects
the myth of the Year-Cycle. The forty days during
which Goliath, who is identified with the Dragon
Tiamat,<a name="FNanchor_46_664" id="FNanchor_46_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_664" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> drew near to the Israelites morning and evening
are symbolical of winter. In the Hebrew text his
height is given as six cubits and a span;<a name="FNanchor_47_665" id="FNanchor_47_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_665" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the figure is
emended to read five cubits and a span, since otherwise
the number would not correspond to the five and a
quarter epagomenal days.<a name="FNanchor_48_666" id="FNanchor_48_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_666" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> With the best will in the
world to be convinced one cannot help feeling that,
even assuming the soundness of the theory, its authors
have let it run away with them. It cannot of course
be denied that astrological conceptions may colour some
of the stories in the Old Testament. The three hundred
foxes, with firebrands tied to their brushes, with which
Samson destroyed the standing corn of the Philistines,
find a striking parallel in the ceremonial which took
place annually in the circus at Rome during the
Cerealia,<a name="FNanchor_49_667" id="FNanchor_49_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_667" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and may well be regarded as folk-mythology
of astrological origin.<a name="FNanchor_50_668" id="FNanchor_50_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_668" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Elijah's chariot of fire may have
been suggested by some astronomical phenomenon,
perhaps a comet; it was probably the product of the
same association of ideas as Medea's dragon-chariot, the
gift of Helios. But this scarcely prepares us to accept
such an allegorizing of details as is proposed in other
passages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>Precisely the same principles of interpretation have
been applied to the heroes of Greek legend. Professor
Jensen of Marburg, in his work on the Babylonian
epic of Gilgamesh, has attempted to trace almost every
figure, not only in the Old Testament, but also in
classical mythology, to a Babylonian source.<a name="FNanchor_51_669" id="FNanchor_51_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_669" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> But his
rather monotonous method of perceiving on all sides
reflexions of his own hero Gilgamesh has already been
criticized sufficiently, and we will take some examples
from a more recent work by Dr. Carl Fries,<a name="FNanchor_52_670" id="FNanchor_52_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_670" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> who has
made other contributions of a less speculative character
upon Greek and Oriental connexions. Elaborating a
published suggestion of Professor Jensen, Dr. Fries has
enthusiastically applied the astral method of interpretation
to the Odyssey. Such an episode as the voyage of
Odysseus to Hades, in order to consult the Theban
prophet Teiresias, undoubtedly presents a close parallel
to the journey of Gilgamesh to Xisuthros in Babylonian
legend; and, though similar traditions are not uncommon
in the epics of other races, the Greek form of
the story may perhaps retain an echo from Babylon.
But a far closer relationship than that is suggested.</p>

<p>The section of the Odyssey which is said to have
been principally exposed to Babylonian influence is the
sojourn of Odysseus in Scheria, the whole episode of his
entertainment by the Phæacians being said to reflect the
Babylonian Feast of the New Year. From the moment
of his awakening on the island we begin to perceive
astral <i>motifs.</i> In Nausicaa's choral game of ball with
her maidens, the ball symbolizes the sun or moon which
revolves from one side of heaven to the other; when it
falls into the river it is the setting sun or moon.
Odysseus, awakened by the maiden's shrill cry, comes
forth from the darkness of the wood: he is the rising
sun. The Way into the city which Nausicaa describes
to Odysseus corresponds to the sacred Procession Street
in Babylon, along which Marduk was carried from his
temple through the city at the Feast of the New Year.
The cult-image on its journey must be protected from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
the gaze of unconsecrated eyes; so Athene sheds a
mist about Odysseus lest any of the Phæacians should
accost him by the way. Other astral elements are
suggested without a specially Babylonian colouring.<a name="FNanchor_53_671" id="FNanchor_53_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_671" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>We are not here concerned with Dr. Fries' theory on
the origin of Greek tragedy, but we may note in passing
that Odysseus, in relating his adventures, is the priestsinger
at the festival of the Light-god. In other parts
of the Odyssey Dr. Fries does not attempt to trace
many astral <i>motifs,</i> though he certainly remarks that the
adventures of Odysseus are merely survivals of astral
myths, and, in spite of a hundred transformations,
ultimately relate only to the journey of the Light-god
over the heavenly ocean.<a name="FNanchor_54_672" id="FNanchor_54_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_672" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The closing scenes of the
Odyssey also receive a thoroughly astrological interpretation,
and moon- and <i>sun-motifs</i> appear promiscuously.
From the speech of Antinous at the trial of the bow we
know that the slaying of the wooers took place at the
Feast of the New Moon, for after Eurymachus and the
other wooers had failed to bend it, he makes the least an
excuse for his proposal to postpone the trial till the
morrow. This fact leads to the suggestion that in
Odysseus returning at the Feast of the New Moon we
are to recognize the Moon-god himself, who triumphs
over the darkness with his bow or crescent. On the
other hand, the twelve axes, through which the arrow
flies, suggest, presumably by their number, the sun.
Penelope wooed by the suitors is the moon whom the
stars surround, and her weaving and unravelling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
web is a moon-<i>motif.</i> Then Odysseus as the sun draws
near, and all the stars are eclipsed at his appearance.</p>

<p>In such hands the astral theory carries its own
antidote, for one cannot but be struck with the ease
with which it may be applied. There is generally no
need to prove a mythological setting to the narrative;
all that is necessary is to assume an astral meaning
beneath the text.<a name="FNanchor_55_673" id="FNanchor_55_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_673" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In fact, one way of demonstrating
its unsoundness has been to apply its methods to the
records of the life of a historical personage.<a name="FNanchor_56_674" id="FNanchor_56_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_674" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> But this
argument amounts at best to a <i>reductio ad absurdum,</i>
and the most damaging criticism has been directed from
the purely astronomical side.</p>

<p>It is well known that the different ecliptic constellations
which make up the signs of the zodiac do not each
occupy thirty degrees of the ecliptic, but that some are
longer and some shorter than others. Also, the constellations
of the Babylonian astronomers during the
late period did not completely coincide with ours. For
instance, the most eastern star of our constellation Virgo
was counted by the Babylonians of the Arsacid era as
belonging to the next ecliptic constellation, Leo, since
it was known as "the hind-foot of the lion."<a name="FNanchor_57_675" id="FNanchor_57_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_675" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But,
fortunately for our purpose, not much doubt can exist as
to the eastern limit of the Twins and the western limit
of the Ram, which mark the beginning and end of the
three World Ages of the astral mythologists. For the
two bright stars, Castor and Pollux, from which the
Twins receive their name were undoubtedly reckoned
in that constellation by the Neo-Babylonians. And the
easternmost star of our constellation of the Fishes (a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
<i>piscium</i>) was probably well beyond the Babylonian
constellation of the Ham.</p>

</div>

<p>Working on this assumption, and assuming thirty
degrees to each of the three intervening constellations,
Dr. Kugler has calculated the years in which the sun
entered these signs of the zodiac at the vernal equinox,
the points, that is to say, at which the astral World-Ages
would have begun and ended. His figures
entirely dispose of Winckler's claim to an astronomical
basis for his astral system. The Age of the Twins,
instead of ending, according to the theory, at about
2800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, really ended in the year 4383 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Thus the
Age of the Bull began over fifteen hundred years before
the birth of Sargon I., who is supposed to have
inaugurated its beginning; and it ended in 2232 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;that
is, considerably before the birth of Hammurabi,
under whom we are told the Bull Age <i>motifs</i> were
principally developed. Moreover, from the time of the
First Dynasty onwards down to the year 81 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;that
is to say, during the whole course of her history&mdash;Babylon
was really living in the Age of the Ham, not
in that of the Bull. Thus all the <i>motifs</i> and myths,
which have been so ingeniously connected with the Bull
sign of the zodiac, ought really to have been connected
with the Ram. But even the astral mythologists admit
that there is not a trace of a Ram-<i>motif</i> in the Babylonian
mythology. Granting all the assumptions made
by Winckler and his school with regard to the astronomical
knowledge of the early Babylonians, the theory
evolved from them is found to be baseless. Winckler's
astronomy was at fault, and his three astrological
World-Ages do not really correspond to his periods of
history.<a name="FNanchor_58_676" id="FNanchor_58_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_676" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Babylon was, indeed, the mother of astronomy no
less than of astrology, and classical antiquity was
indebted to her in no small measure: but, strictly
speaking, her scientific observations do not date from a
very early period. It is true we have evidence that,
as early as the close of the third millennium, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
astronomers recorded observations of the planet Venus,<a name="FNanchor_59_677" id="FNanchor_59_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_677" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
and there is also a fragment of an early text which shows
that they attempted to measure approximately the
positions of the fixed stars. But their art of measuring
remained for a long time primitive, and it was only the
later Babylonians, of the period from the sixth to the first
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, who were enabled to fix with sufficient
accuracy the movements of the planets, especially those
of the moon, and by this means to found a reliable system
of time-measurement. The mere fact that the astrological
texts, even in the late Assyrian period, treat
eclipses as possible on any day of the month, and use the
term for any kind of obscuration of the sun and moon,
is sufficient evidence that they had not at that time
noted their regular occurrence and still had comparatively
crude notions of astronomy.<a name="FNanchor_60_678" id="FNanchor_60_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_678" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The earliest scientific document in the strict sense of
the word dates from the second half of the sixth century,
when we find for the first time that the relative positions
of the sun and moon were calculated in advance,
as well as the conjunction of the moon with the planets
and of the planets with each other, their position being
noted in the signs of the zodiac. But the tablets
afford no evidence that the Babylonian astronomers
possessed any knowledge of the precession of the
equinoxes before the close of the second century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
and the traditional ascription of the discovery to
Hipparchus of Nicæa, working between the years 161
and 126 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> on the observations of his Babylonian predecessors,
may be accepted as accurate.<a name="FNanchor_61_679" id="FNanchor_61_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_679" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, in short, no grounds for the theory that
the Babylonians divided the history of the world into
astral ages, nor that their myths and legends had any
peculiar connexion with successive signs of the zodiac.
That astrology formed an important section of the
Babylonian religious system from an early period there
can be no doubt; but at that time the stars and
planets did not exercise any preponderating influence
on religious belief, and many features of the system,
for which an astral origin has been confidently assumed,
must be traced to a simpler and more primitive association
of ideas.<a name="FNanchor_62_680" id="FNanchor_62_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_680" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> But the necessary modification of the
astral theory still leaves open the possibility that
Hebrew literature may have acquired a strong astrological
tinge in the Exilic and post-Exilic periods.
Were Jewish traditions affected in Babylon, for example,
in some such way as the Mithraie legends from Persia?
Since the astral theory has no claim to dictate the
answer for us, the question must be decided by the
ordinary rules of historical and literary evidence.</p>

<p>If we are to assume that Babylonian astrology
exerted so marked an influence on the Jews of the
Exile, we should at least expect to find some traces
of it in practical matters and in terminology. And
in this connexion there are certain facts which have
never been fairly met by the astral mycologists.<a name="FNanchor_63_681" id="FNanchor_63_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_681" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> It
is true that the returning exiles under Zerubbabel had
adopted the Babylonian names of the months for civil
use; but the idea of hours&mdash;that is to say, the division
of the day into equal parts&mdash;does not seem to have
occurred to the Jews till long after the Exile, and even
then there is no trace of the Babylonian double hour.<a name="FNanchor_64_682" id="FNanchor_64_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_682" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
The other fact is still more significant. With the
exception of a single reference to the planet Saturn by
the prophet Amos,<a name="FNanchor_65_683" id="FNanchor_65_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_683" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> none of the Hebrew names for
the stars and constellations, which occur in the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
Testament, correspond to those we know were in use in
Babylon. Such a tact is surely decisive against any
wholesale adoption of astral mythology from Babylon
on the part of the writers or redactors of the Old
Testament, whether in pre-Exilic or in post-Exilic
times. But it is quite compatible with the view that
some of the imagery, and even certain lines of thought,
occurring in the poetical and prophetic books of the
Hebrews, betray a Babylonian colouring and may find
their explanation in the cuneiform literature. There
can be no doubt that the Babylonian texts have afforded
invaluable assistance in the effort to trace the working
of the oriental mind in antiquity.</p>

<p>With regard to the suggested influence of Babylon
on Greek religious thought, it is essential to realize
that the temperaments of the Babylonian and the
Hellene were totally distinct, the fanatic and self-abasing
spirit of the East contrasting vividly with the coolness,
civic sobriety, and self-confidence of the West. This
has been pointed out by Dr. Farnell,<a name="FNanchor_66_684" id="FNanchor_66_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_684" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> who lays special
emphasis on the total absence of any trace in Mesopotamian
cults of those religious mysteries, which, as
he has shown elsewhere, formed so essential a feature
in Hellenic and Ægean society.<a name="FNanchor_67_685" id="FNanchor_67_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_685" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Another fact in which
he would see significance is that the use of incense,
universal from immemorial times in Babylonia, was not
introduced into Greece before the eighth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
This little product, it will be readily admitted, was much
easier to import than Babylonian theology. Few will
disagree with him in regarding the suggestion, that for
long centuries the Hittite empire was a barrier between
Mesopotamia and the coast-lands of Asia Minor,<a name="FNanchor_68_686" id="FNanchor_68_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_686" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> as a
sufficient reason for this check in the direct spread
of Babylonian influence westward. But no political
barrier is effective against the tales that are remembered
by travelling merchants and are retold around the
camp-fires of the caravan. That Babylon should have
contributed in some degree to the rich store of legends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
current in various forms throughout the region of the
eastern Mediterranean is what one would expect.</p>

<p>The cultural influence of Babylonia had from the
earliest period penetrated eastward, and the civilization
of Elam, her nearest neighbour, had been to a great
extent moulded by that of Sumer. But even at that
time the trade-routes had been open to the west, and
before the rise of Babylon both soldier and merchant
had passed from the lower Euphrates into Syria. With
the expansion of the Western Semites the two regions
were drawn into more intimate relationship, and the
political control of the middle Euphrates, first established
in the age of Hammurabi, was followed by an
increased commercial traffic, which continued with few
interruptions into the Neo-Babylonian and later periods.
Babylon's foreign policy was always dominated by the
necessity of keeping her connexion open with the west:
and it was mainly due to her commercial enterprise, and
not to any territorial ambitions, that her culture reached
the farther limits of Palestine and has left some traces
in Greek mythology.</p>

traced in unexpected quarters. Thus the men of Gilead are explained to
have chosen the word <i>shibboleth,</i> "ear of grain," as a password for the
Ephraemites, not because it was a common word containing the required
sibilant, but in honour of the goddess Ishtar, the heavenly Virgin with the
ears of corn. And, though the veil was part of the ordinary attire of Hebrew
women, a natural act such as that told of Rebecca, who is said to have veiled
herself at the approach of Isaac, is held to reflect the Ishtar cult.</p></div>

a new age in Israel's history; the traditions about him thus bristle with
astral <i>motifs.</i> When he is persecuted by Pharaoh in Egypt, Pharaoh is the
Dragon; when he is rescued as a babe from the Nile, Pharaoh's daughter is
Ishtar, Queen of heaven, and we have a Tammuz-Ishtar <i>motif.</i> When he
leads Israel out of Egypt, we have the <i>motif</i> of victory over the Dragon. The
crossing of the Red Sea is the cleaving of the Dragon in half, and so too is
Joshua's passage of the Jordan. In short, Joshua in his character of deliverer
rivals Moses in the number of <i>motifs</i> which are said to cluster round him.</p></div>

have here mixed valuable suggestions with pure theorizing. Certain numbers
were specially sacred among the Babylonians and were employed as divine
names. Sin, the Moon-god, for example, was the god "Thirty," from the
conventional length of the lunar month; and the gods "Four" and "Seven"
may have represented different aspects of the Moon-god, the former the four
phases of the moon, the latter the seven-day week as a lunar quarter. If the
idea travelled westward, we obtain a satisfactory explanation of such Palestinian
names as Kiriath-arba and Be'er-sheba'. For this subject, see especially
Prof. Burney's forthcoming work on "Judges" (see above, <a href="#Page_290">p. 290</a> n. 3),
p. 43 f. Discussions are there given of other points illustrated by the Babylonian
texts, of which special mention may be made of the exhaustive notes
on Yahwe (pp. 243 ff.) and the Ashera (pp. 196 ff.), and the valuable section>
on early Hebrew poetry.</p></div>

the task of preparing the ship and escorting Odysseus homewards may correspond
to the fifty-two weeks of the year, sun-heroes who accompany the sun
on his voyage through the year. In the challenge of Euryalus to Odysseus
and the latter's triumph in the discus-throwing, we are to see a glimmer of
the old light-myth. The dance of Halius and Laodamas, with the purple ball
which Polybus made for them, again symbolizes the battle of light, the colour
of the ball being specially significant. Indeed, there are few limits to be
placed to this system of astrological interpretation, since, according to
Dr. Fries, even lawn-tennis goes back to the same idea: he remarks that
"ailes Ballspiel ja bis herab zum Lawn-Tennis auf denselben Gedanken [der
Lichtkampf] zurückgeht" ("Studien zur Odyssée," i., p. 324).</p></div>

the prophecy that death shall come to Odysseus from the sea; for this is
traced
to the Babylonian legend of Oannes, the benefactor of mankind, who
ever returns to the sea from which he rose, but here, too, Odysseus is the
god of heaven who sinks at the approach of night.</p></div>

theory of the Solar Myth. The demonstration, though humorous (since its
subject was the professor himself), constituted a legitimate form of criticism,
and it has been borrowed by Dr. Kugler, the Dutch astronomer, and applied
to the astral theory. For the astral theory is in essence the old Solar Myth
revived and grafted on to a Babylonian stem. In his book "Im Bannkreis
Babels" (1910), Dr. Kugler selects at random the historical figure of Louis IX.
of France, and has no difficulty in demonstrating by astral methods that the
extant records of his life and reign are full of solar and astral <i>motifs.</i></p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
